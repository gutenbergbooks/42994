<p><b>Korono.</b>&mdash;Karnam, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e449src" href="#xd21e449" name="xd21e449src">1</a>
&ldquo;includes both Karnam proper, and also Korono, the accountant
caste of Ganjam and Orissa. The following remarks relate solely to the
Uriya Koronos. The word Korono is said to be derived from kir&#257;ni,
which means a writer or clerk. The origin of the Koronos is uncertain.
One writer says that they are K&#257;yasts of Northern India, who are
of Kshatriya origin. Mr. R. C. Dutt says, in his History of Ancient
India, that, according to Manu, the Koronos belong to the Kshatriya
Vratyas, who do not perform the religious rites. And, in the
Raghuvamsa, the poet K&#257;lid&#257;sa describes Koronos as the
offspring of a Vaisya and a S&#363;dra woman, and he is supported by
the lexicographer Amara Sinha. It is said that the ancestors of the
Koronos were brought from Northern India by Yay&#257;tik&#275;sari,
King of Orissa (447&mdash;526 A.D.), to supply the want of writers and
clerks in certain parts of Orissa. The Koronos are worshippers of
Vishnu. Their ceremonies are performed with the aid of Br&#257;hman
priests. The remarriage of widows is not permitted. They eat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>fish, and the flesh of goats and deer. The Uriya
Koronos observe the g&#333;sha system, and carry it to such an extent
that, after a girl attains puberty, she is not allowed to appear before
her elder brother. Their titles are Patnaik and Mahanti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heads of the Ganjam villages are, Mr. S. P. Rice informs us,
&ldquo;called Korono, the doer, and Karji, the manager. The Korono, who
is really only the accountant, but who, by reason of his higher
education, is generally the ultimate authority in the village,
appropriates to himself the title Potonaiko, as his caste distinction.
The word signifies the Naik or head of the town.&rdquo; It has been
noted that &ldquo;in the Telugu districts, the Karnam is usually a
Br&#257;hman. Being in some respects the most intelligent, and the most
unpopular man in the village, he is both feared and hated. Murders of
accountants, though infrequent, are not unknown.&rdquo; Of proverbs
relating to Karnams, the following may be quoted:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Even if a thousand pagodas are levied from a village,
not even a cash will be levied from the Karnam (a pagoda is a gold, and
a cash a copper coin).</p>
<p>The Karnam is the cause of the K&#257;pu&rsquo;s (cultivator caste)
death.</p>
<p>The hungry Karnam looks into his old accounts (to worry his
creditors).</p>
<p>The co-operation of the Karnam is as necessary as the axles to the
wheels of a cart.</p>
<p>One Karnam to one village.</p>
<p>A quiet Karnam is as little cared for as a tame elephant.</p>
<p>If a Karnam trusts another, his end is near.</p>
<p>If an enemy is his neighbour; if another Karnam is his superior; if
the K&#257;pu bears complaints against him, a Karnam cannot live
on.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=

<p>The Koronos are divided into various sections, <i>e.g.</i>, Sishta
or Srishti, Vaisya, Majjula, and Matihansa, some of which wear the
sacred thread. The Vaisyas are not allowed to marry their girls after
puberty, whereas the others may marry them before or after this event.
A woman of the Bh&#333;ndari caste is employed on the occasion of
marriage and other ceremonies, to perform certain duties, for which her
services are indispensable.</p>

<p><b>Korti.</b>&mdash;An occupational name, derived from korto, a saw,
of woodsawyers in Ganjam.</p>
<p><b>K&#333;salya.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of M&#257;li, named after
K&#333;sala, the modern Oudh.</p>
<p><b>K&#333;shti.</b>&mdash;K&#333;shti or K&#333;shta is the name of
a weaving and cultivating caste of Chota Nagpur, a few members of which
have settled in the Madras Presidency (<i>see</i> Risley, Tribes and
Castes of Bengal). K&#333;shta is also the name by which the Khatris of
Conjeeveram call the Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran silk weavers.</p>
<p><b>Kota.</b>&mdash;According to Dr. Oppert<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e506src" href="#xd21e506" name="xd21e506src">2</a> &ldquo;it seems
probable that the Todas and Kotas lived near each other before the
settlement of the latter on the Nilagiri. Their dialects betray a great
resemblance. According to a tradition of theirs (the Kotas), they lived
formerly on Kollimallai, a mountain in Mysore. It is wrong to connect
the name of the Kotas with cow-slaying, and to derive it from the
Sanskrit g&#333;-haty&#257; (cow-killer). The derivation of the term
Kota is, as clearly indicated, from the Gauda-dravidian word ko (ku)
mountain, and the Kotas belong to the Gandian branch.&rdquo; There is a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>tradition that the Kotas were formerly one with the
Todas, with whom they tended the herds of buffaloes in common. But, on
one occasion, they were found to be eating the flesh of a buffalo which
had died, and the Todas drove them out as being eaters of carrion. A
native report before me suggests that &ldquo;it is probable that, after
the migration of the Kotas to the hills, anthropology was at work, and
they got into them an admixture of Toda blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kotas inhabit seven villages (K&#333;tagiri or k&#333;k&#257;l),
of which six&mdash;Kotagiri, K&#299;l Kotagiri, Todan&#257;d,
Shol&#363;r, Kethi and K&#363;nda&mdash;are on the N&#299;lgiri
plateau, and one is at Gudal&#363;r at the north-west base of these
hills. They form compact communities, and, at Kotagiri, their village
consists of detached huts, and rows of huts arranged in streets. The
huts are built of mud, brick, or stone, roofed with thatch or tiles,
and divided into living and sleeping apartments. The floor is raised
above the ground, and there is a verandah in front with a seat on each
side whereon the Kota loves to &ldquo;take his siesta, and smoke his
cheroot in the shade,&rdquo; or sleep off the effects of a drinking
bout. The door-posts of some of the huts are ornamented with carving
executed by wood-carvers in the plains. A few of the huts, and one of
the forges at Kotagiri, have stone pillars sculptured with fishes,
lotuses, and floral embellishments by stone-carvers from the low
country. It is noted by Breeks<a class="noteref" id="xd21e514src" href=
"#xd21e514" name="xd21e514src">3</a> that Kurguli (Shol&#363;r) is the
oldest of the Kota villages, and that the Badagas believe that the
Kotas of this village were made by the Todas. At Kurguli there is a
temple of the same form as the Toda dairy, and this is said to be the
only temple of the kind at any Kota village. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Kotas speak a mixture of Tamil and Kanarese, and speak Tamil
without the foreign accent which is noticeable in the case of the
Badagas and Todas. According to orthodox Kota views, a settlement
should consist of three streets or k&#275;ris, in one of which the
Terk&#257;ran or D&#275;v&#257;di, and in the other two the
Munthakann&#257;ns or P&#363;j&#257;ris live. At Kotagiri the three
streets are named K&#299;lk&#275;ri, Naduk&#275;ri, and
M&#275;lk&#275;ri, or lower, central, and upper street. People
belonging to the same k&#275;ri may not intermarry, as they are
supposed to belong to the same family, and intermarriage would be
distasteful. The following examples of marriage between members of
different k&#275;ris are recorded in my notes:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Kota settlement at Sh&#333;l&#363;r is divided into four
k&#275;ris, viz.:&mdash;amr&#275;ri, kik&#275;ri, korak&#275;ri, and
akk&#275;ri, or near street, lower street, other street, and that
street, which resolve themselves into two exogamous groups. Of these,
amr&#275;ri and kik&#275;ri constitute one group, and korak&#275;ri and
akk&#275;ri the other.</p>
<p>On the day following my arrival at Kotagiri, a deputation of Kotas
waited on me, which included a very old man bearing a certificate
appointing him headman of the community in recognition of his services
and good character, and a confirmed drunkard with a grog-blossom nose,
who attributed the inordinate size thereof to the acrid juice of a
tree, which he was felling, dropping on it. The besetting vice of the
Kotas of Kotagiri is a partiality for drink, and they congregate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>together towards dusk in the arrack shop and beer
tavern in the bazar, whence they stagger or are helped home in a state
of noisy and turbulent intoxication. It has been said<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e558src" href="#xd21e558" name="xd21e558src">4</a> that the
Kotas &ldquo;actually court venereal disease, and a young man who has
not suffered from this before he is of a certain age is looked upon as
a disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kotas are looked down on as being unclean feeders, and eaters of
carrion; a custom which is to them no more filthy than that of eating
game when it is high, or using the same tooth-brush week after week, is
to a European. They have been described as a very carnivorous race, who
&ldquo;have a great craving for flesh, and will devour animal food of
every kind without any squeamish scruples as to how the animal came by
its death. The carcase of a bullock which has died of disease, or the
remains of a deer half devoured by a tiger, are equally acceptable to
him.&rdquo; An unappetising sight, which may be witnessed on roads
leading to a Kota village, is that of a Kota carrying the flesh of a
dead buffalo, often in an advanced stage of putridity, slung on a stick
across his shoulders, with the entrails trailing on the ground. Colonel
Ross King narrates<a class="noteref" id="xd21e563src" href="#xd21e563"
name="xd21e563src">5</a> how he once saw a Kota carrying home a dead
rat, thrown out of a stable a day or two previously. When I repeated
this story to my Kota informant, he glared at me, and bluntly remarked
in Tamil &ldquo;The book tells lies.&rdquo; Despite its unpleasant
nature, the carrion diet evidently agrees with the Kotas, who are a
sturdy set of people, flourishing, it is said, most exceedingly when
the hill cattle are dying of epidemic disease, and the supply of meat
is consequently abundant. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href=
"#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>The missionary Metz narrates<a class="noteref" id="xd21e569src"
href="#xd21e569" name="xd21e569src">6</a> that &ldquo;some years ago
the Kotas were anxious to keep buffaloes, but the headmen of the other
tribes immediately put their veto upon it, declaring that it was a
great presumption on the part of such unclean creatures to wish to have
anything to do with the holy occupation of milking
buffaloes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kotas are blacksmiths, goldsmiths, silversmiths, carpenters,
tanners, rope-makers, potters, washermen, and cultivators. They are the
musicians at Toda and Badaga funerals. It is noted by Dr. W. H. R.
Rivers<a class="noteref" id="xd21e574src" href="#xd21e574" name=
"xd21e574src">7</a> that &ldquo;in addition they provide for the first
Toda funeral the cloak (putkuli) in which the body is wrapped, and
grain (patm or s(=a)mai) to the amount of five to ten kwa. They give
one or two rupees towards the expenses, and, if they should have no
grain, their contribution of money is increased. At the marvainolkedr
(second funeral ceremony) their contributions are more extensive. They
provide the putkuli, together with a sum of eight annas, for the
decoration of the cloak by the Toda women. They give two to five rupees
towards the general expenses, and provide the bow and arrow, basket
(tek), knife (kafkati), and the sieve called kudshmurn. The Kotas
receive at each funeral the bodies of the slaughtered buffaloes, and
are also usually given food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though all classes look down on the Kotas, all are agreed that they
are excellent artisans, whose services as smiths, rope and umbrella
makers, etc., are indispensable to the other hill tribes. The strong,
durable ropes, made out of buffalo hide, are much sought after by
Badagas for fastening their cattle. The Kotas at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>Gudal&#363;r
have the reputation of being excellent thatchers. The Todas claim that
the Kotas are a class of artisans specially brought up from the plains
to work for them. Each Toda, Badaga, Irula, and Kurumba settlement has
its Muttu Kotas, who work for the inhabitants thereof, and supply them
with sundry articles, called muttu, in return for the carcasses of
buffaloes and cattle, ney (clarified butter), grain, plantain, etc. The
Kotas eat the flesh of the animals which they receive, and sell the
horns to Labbai (Muhammadan) merchants from the plains. Chakkiliyans
(leather-workers) from the plains collect the bones, and purchase the
hides, which are roughly cured by the Kotas with chunam (lime) and
&#257;varam (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>) bark, and pegged out on the
ground to dry.</p>
<p>The Kota blacksmiths make hatches, bill-hooks, knives, and other
implements for the various hill tribes, especially the Badagas, and
also for European planters. Within the memory of men still living, they
used to work with iron ore brought up from the low country, but now
depend on scrap iron, which they purchase locally in the bazar. The
most flourishing smithy in the Kotagiri village is made of bricks of
local manufacture, roofed with zinc sheets, and fitted with anvil
pincers, etc., of European manufacture.</p>
<p>As agriculturists the Kotas are said to be quite on a par with the
Badagas, and they raise on the land adjacent to their villages crops of
potatoes, bearded wheat (akki or rice ganji), barley (beer ganji),
k&#299;rai (<i>Amarantus</i>), s&#257;mai (<i>Panicum miliare</i>),
korali (<i>Setaria italica</i>), mustard, onions, etc.</p>
<p>At the revenue settlement, 1885, the Kotas were treated in the same
way as the Badagas and other tribes of the N&#299;lgiris, except the
Todas, and the lands in their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=
"#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>occupation were assigned to them at
rates varying from ten to twenty annas per acre. The bhurty or shifting
system of cultivation, under which the Kotas held their lands, was
formally, but nominally, abolished in 1862&ndash;64; but it was
practically and finally done away with at the revenue settlement of the
N&#299;lgiri plateau. The Kota lands are now held on puttas under the
ordinary ryotwari tenure.</p>
<p>In former days, opium of good quality was cultivated by the Badagas,
from whom the Kotas got poppy-heads, which their herbalists used for
medicinal purposes. At the present time, the Kotas purchase opium in
the bazar, and use it as an intoxicant.</p>
<p>The Kota women have none of the fearlessness and friendliness of the
Todas, and, on the approach of a European to their domain, bolt out of
sight, like frighted rabbits in a warren, and hide within the inmost
recesses of their huts. As a rule they are clad in filthily dirty
clothes, all tattered and torn, and frequently not reaching as low as
the knees. In addition to domestic duties, the women have to do work in
the fields, fetch water and collect firewood, with loads of which,
supported on the head by a pad of bracken fern (<i>Pteris aquilina</i>)
leaves, and bill-hook slung on the shoulder, old and young women, girls
and boys, may continually be seen returning to the Kotagiri village.
The women also make baskets, and rude earthen pots from a black clay
found in swamps on a potter&rsquo;s wheel. This consists of a disc made
of dry mud, with an iron spike, by means of which it is made to revolve
in a socket in a stone fixed in the space in front of the houses, which
also acts as a threshing-floor. The earthenware vessels used by the
Todas for cooking purposes, and those used in dairy work, except those
of the inner room of the ti <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>(sacred dairy), are said by Dr.
Rivers to be made by the Kotas.</p>
<p>The Kota priesthood is represented by two classes, Munthakann&#257;n
or P&#363;j&#257;ri, and Terk&#257;ran or D&#275;v&#257;di, of whom the
former rank higher than the latter. There may be more than two
Terk&#257;rans in a village, but the Munthakann&#257;ns never exceed
this number, and they should belong to different k&#275;ris. These
representatives of the priesthood must not be widowers, and, if they
lose their wives while holding office, their appointment lapses. They
may eat the flesh of buffaloes, but not drink their milk. Cow&rsquo;s
flesh, but not its milk, is tabu. The Kotas may not milk cows, or,
under ordinary conditions, drink the milk thereof in their own village,
but are permitted to do so if it is given to them by a
P&#363;j&#257;ri, or in a village other than their own. The duties of
the Munthakann&#257;n include milking the cows of the village, service
to the god, and participation in the seed-sowing and reaping
ceremonial. They must use fire obtained by friction, and should keep a
fire constantly burning in a broken pot. In like manner, the
Terk&#257;rans must not use matches, but take fire from the house of
the Munthakann&#257;n. The members of the priesthood are not allowed to
work for others, but may do so on their own account in the fields or at
the forge. They should avoid pollution, and may not attend a Toda or
Badaga funeral, or approach the seclusion hut set apart for Kota women.
When a vacancy in the office of Munthakann&#257;n occurs, the Kotas of
the village gather together, and seek the guidance of the
Terk&#257;ran, who becomes inspired by the deity, and announces the
name of the successor. The selected individual has to be fed at the
expense of the community for three months, during which time he may not
speak <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>to his wife or other woman direct, but only
through the medium of a boy, who acts as his assistant. Further, during
this period of probation, he may not sleep on a mat or use a blanket,
but must lie on the ground or on a plank, and use a dhupati (coarse
cloth) as a covering. At the time of the annual temple festival,
neither the Munthakann&#257;ns nor the Terk&#257;rans may live or hold
communion with their wives for fear of pollution, and they have to cook
their food themselves.</p>
<p>The seed-sowing ceremony is celebrated in the month of Kumbam
(February-March) on a Tuesday or Friday. For eight days the
P&#363;j&#257;ri abstains from meat and lives on vegetable dietary, and
may not communicate directly with his wife, a boy acting as spokesman.
On the Sunday before the ceremony, a number of cows are penned in a
kraal, and milked by the P&#363;j&#257;ri. The milk is preserved, and,
if the omens are favourable, is said not to turn sour. If it does, this
is attributed to the P&#363;j&#257;ri being under pollution from some
cause or other. On the day of the ceremony, the P&#363;j&#257;ri bathes
in a stream, and proceeds, accompanied by a boy, to a field or the
forest. After worshipping the gods, he makes a small seed-pan in the
ground, and sows therein a small quantity of r&#257;gi (<i>Elusine
Coracana</i>). Meanwhile, the Kotas of the village go to the temple,
and clean it. Thither the P&#363;j&#257;ri and the boy proceed, and the
deity is worshipped with offerings of cocoanuts, betel, flowers, etc.
Sometimes the Terk&#257;ran becomes inspired, and gives expression to
oracular utterances. From the temple all go to the house of the
P&#363;j&#257;ri, who gives them a small quantity of milk and food.
Three months later, on an auspicious day, the reaping of the crop is
commenced with a very similar form of ceremonial. <span class=

<p>During the seed-sowing festival, Mr. Harkness, writing in
1832,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e623src" href="#xd21e623" name=
"xd21e623src">8</a> informs us, &ldquo;offerings are made in the
temples, and, on the day of the full moon, after the whole have
partaken of a feast, the blacksmith and the gold and silversmith,
constructing separately a forge and furnace within the temple, each
makes something in the way of has avocation, the blacksmith a chopper
or axe, the silversmith a ring or other kind of ornament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some rude image,&rdquo; Dr. Shortt writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e628src" href="#xd21e628" name="xd21e628src">9</a> &ldquo;of
wood or stone, a rock or tree in a secluded locality, frequently forms
the Kota&rsquo;s object of worship, to which sacrificial offerings are
made; but the recognised place of worship in each village consists of a
large square of ground, walled round with loose stones, three feet
high, and containing in its centre two<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e631src" href="#xd21e631" name="xd21e631src">10</a> pent-shaped
sheds of thatch, open before and behind, and on the posts (of stone)
that support them some rude circles and other figures are drawn. No
image of any sort is visible here.&rdquo; These sheds, which at
Kotagiri are a very short distance apart, are dedicated to Siva and his
consort Parvati under the names of K&#257;matar&#257;ya and
K&#257;likai. Though no representation thereof is exhibited in the
temples at ordinary times, their spirits are believed to pervade the
buildings, and at the annual ceremony they are represented by two thin
plates of silver, which are attached to the upright posts of the
temples. The stones surrounding the temples at Kotagiri are scratched
with various quaint devices, and lines for the games of kot&#275; and
hulikot&#275;. The Kotas go, I was told, to the temple once a month, at
full moon, and worship the gods. Their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>belief is that
K&#257;matar&#257;ya created the Kotas, Todas, and Kurumbas, but not
the Irulas. &ldquo;Tradition says of K&#257;matar&#257;ya that,
perspiring profusely, he wiped from his forehead three drops of
perspiration, and out of them formed the three most ancient of the hill
tribes&mdash;the Todas, Kurumbas, and Kotas. The Todas were told to
live principally upon milk, the Kurumbas were permitted to eat the
flesh of buffalo calves, and the Kotas were allowed perfect liberty in
the choice of food, being informed that they might eat carrion if they
could get nothing better.&rdquo; According to another version of this
legend given by Dr. Rivers, K&#257;matar&#257;ya &ldquo;gave to each
people a pot. In the Toda pot was calf-flesh, and so the Todas eat the
flesh of calves at the erkumptthpimi ceremony; the Kurumba pot
contained the flesh of a male buffalo, so this is eaten by the
Kurumbas. The pot of the Kotas contained the flesh of a cow-buffalo,
which may, therefore, be eaten by this people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e637width" id="pl4-013"><img src=
"images/pl4-013.jpg" alt="Kota temple." width="720" height="524">
<p class="figureHead">Kota temple.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to K&#257;matar&#257;ya and Mangk&#257;li, the Kotas at
G&#363;dal&#363;r, which is near the Malabar frontier, worship
Vettakarasw&#257;mi, Adiral and Udiral, and observe the Malabar
&#332;nam festival. The Kotas worship further M&#257;g&#257;li, to
whose influence outbreaks of cholera are attributed, and M&#257;riamma,
who is held responsible for smallpox. When cholera breaks out among the
Kota community, special sacrifices are performed with a view to
propitiating the wrath of the goddess. M&#257;g&#257;li is represented
by an upright stone in a rude temple at a little distance from
Kotagiri, where an annual ceremony takes place, at which some man
becomes possessed, and announces to the people that M&#257;g&#257;li
has come. The P&#363;j&#257;ri offers up plantains and cocoanuts, and
sacrifices a sheep and fowls. My informant was, or pretended to be
ignorant of the following legend recorded by Breeks as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>to the
origin of the worship of the smallpox goddess. &ldquo;A virulent
disease carried off a number of Kotas of Peranganoda, and the village
was abandoned by the survivors. A Badaga named Munda Jogi, who was
bringing his tools to the Kotagiri to be sharpened, saw near a tree
something in the form of a tiger, which spoke to him, and told him to
summon the run-away Kotas. He obeyed, whereupon the tiger form
addressed the Kotas in an unknown tongue, and vanished. For some time,
the purport of this communication remained a mystery. At last, however,
a Kota came forward to interpret, and declared that the god ordered the
Kotas to return to the village on pain of a recurrence of the
pestilence. The command was obeyed, and a Sw&#257;mi house (shrine) was
built on the spot where the form appeared to the Badaga (who doubtless
felt keenly the inconvenience of having no Kotas at hand to sharpen his
tools).&rdquo; The Kotas are not allowed to approach Toda or Badaga
temples.</p>
<p>It was noted by Lieutenant R. F. Burton<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e647src" href="#xd21e647" name="xd21e647src">11</a> that, in some
hamlets, the Kotas have set up curiously carved stones, which they
consider sacred, and attribute to them the power of curing diseases, if
the member affected be only rubbed against the talisman.</p>
<p>A great annual festival is held in honour of K&#257;matar&#257;ya
with the ostensible object of propitiating him with a view to his
giving the Kotas an abundant harvest and general prosperity. The feast
commences on the first Monday after the January new moon, and lasts
over many days, which are observed as a general holiday. The festival
is said to be a continuous scene of licentiousness and debauchery, much
indecent dancing taking place between men and women. According to
Metz,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e652src" href="#xd21e652" name=
"xd21e652src">12</a> the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>chief men among the Badagas must
attend, otherwise their absence would be regarded as a breach of
friendship and etiquette, and the Kotas would avenge themselves by
refusing to make ploughs or earthen vessels for the Badagas. The
programme, when the festival is carried out in full detail, is, as far
as I have been able to gather, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>First day. A fire is kindled by one of the priests in the temple,
and carried to the Naduk&#275;ri section of the village, where it is
kept burning throughout the festival. Around the fire men, women,
adolescent boys and girls, dance to the weird music of the Kota band,
whose instruments consist of clarionet, drum, tambourine, brass horn
and flute (buguri).</p>

</div>
<p>Sixth day. The villagers go to the jungle and collect bamboos and
rattans, with which to re-roof the temple. Dance at night.</p>
<p>The seventh day is busily spent in re-roofing and decorating the
temples, and it is said to be essential that the work should be
concluded before nightfall. Dance at night.</p>
<p>Eighth day. In the morning the Kotas go to Badaga villages, and
cadge for presents of grain and gh&#299; (clarified butter), which they
subsequently cook, place in front of the temple as an offering to the
god, and, after the priests have eaten, partake of, seated round the
temple.</p>
<p>Ninth day. Kotas, Todas, Badagas, Kurumbas, Irulas, and
&lsquo;Hindus&rsquo; come to the Kota village, where an elaborate
nautch is performed, in which men are the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>principal actors, dressed
up in gaudy attire consisting of skirt, petticoat, trousers, turban and
scarves, and freely decorated with jewelry, which is either their own
property, or borrowed from Badagas for the occasion. Women merely
dressed in clean cloths also take part in a dance called kumi, which
consists of a walk round to time beaten with the hands. I was present
at a private performance of the male nautch, which was as dreary as
such entertainments usually are, but it lacked the go which is
doubtless put into it when it is performed under natural conditions
away from the restraining influence of the European. The nautch is
apparently repeated daily until the conclusion of the festival.</p>
<p>Eleventh and twelfth days. A burlesque representation of a Toda
funeral is given, at which the part of the sacrificial buffaloes is
played by men with buffalo horns fixed on the head, and body covered
with a black cloth.</p>
<p>At the close of the festival, the Kota priests and leading members
of the community go out hunting with bows and arrows, leaving the
village at 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>, and returning at 3
<span class="sc">A.M.</span> They are said to have formerly shot
&lsquo;bison&rsquo; (<i lang="la-x-bio">Bos gaurus</i>) at this
nocturnal expedition, but what takes place at the present day is said
to be unknown to the villagers, who are forbidden to leave their houses
during the absence of the hunting party. On their return to the
village, a fire is lighted by friction. Into the fire a piece of iron
is put by one of the priests, made red hot with the assistance of the
bellows, and hammered. The priests then offer up a parting prayer to
the god, and the festival is at an end.</p>
<p>The following is a translation of a description by Dr. Emil
Schmidt<a class="noteref" id="xd21e702src" href="#xd21e702" name=
"xd21e702src">13</a> of the dancing at the Kota annual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>festival, at which he had the good fortune to be
present as an eye-witness:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During my stay at Kotagiri the Kotas were celebrating the big
festival in honour of their chief god. The feast lasted over twelve
days, during which homage was offered to the god every evening, and a
dance performed round a fire kept burning near the temple throughout
the feast. On the last evening but one, females, as well as males, took
part in the dance. As darkness set in, the shrill music, which
penetrated to my hotel, attracted me to the Kota village. At the end of
the street, which adjoins the back of the temple, a big fire was kept
up by continually putting on large long bundles of brushwood. On one
side of the fire, close to the flames, stood the musicians with their
musical instruments, two hand-drums, a tambourine, beaten by blows on
the back, a brass cymbal beaten with a stick, and two pipes resembling
oboes. Over and over again the same monotonous tune was repeated by the
two latter in quick four-eight time to the accompaniment of the other
instruments. On my arrival, about forty male Kotas, young and old, were
dancing round the fire, describing a semicircle, first to one side,
then the other, raising the hands, bending the knees, and executing
fantastic steps with the feet. The entire circle moved thus slowly
forwards, one or the other from time to time giving vent to a shout
that sounded like Hau! and, at the conclusion of the dance, there was a
general shout all round. Around the circle, partly on the piles of
stone near the temple, were seated a number of Kotas of both sexes. A
number of Badagas of good position, who had been specially invited to
the feast, sat round a small fire on a raised place, which abuts on the
back wall of the temple. The dance over, the circle of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>dancers
broke up. The drummers held their instruments, rendered damp and lax by
the moist evening breeze, so close to the flames that I thought they
would get burnt. Soon the music began again to a new tune; first the
oboes, and then, as soon as they had got into the proper swing, the
other instruments. The melody was not the same as before, but its two
movements were repeated without intercession or change. In this dance
females, as well as males, took part, grouped in a semicircle, while
the men completed the circle. The men danced boisterously and
irregularly. Moving slowly forwards with the entire circle, each dancer
turned right round from right to left and from left to right, so that,
after every turn, they were facing the fire. The women danced with more
precision and more artistically than the men. When they set out on the
dance, they first bowed themselves before the fire, and then made left
and right half turns with artistic regular steps. Their countenances
expressed a mixture of pleasure and embarrassment. None of the dancers
wore any special costume, but the women, who were nearly all old and
ugly, had, for the most part, a quantity of ornaments in the ears and
nose and on the neck, arms and legs. In the third dance, played once
more in four-eight times, only females took part. It was the most
artistic of all, and the slow movements had evidently been well
rehearsed beforehand. The various figures consisted of stepping
radially to and fro, turning, stepping forwards and backwards, etc.,
with measured seriousness and solemn dignity. It was for the women,
who, at other times, get very little enjoyment, the most important and
happiest day in the whole year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with Kota ceremonials, Dr. Rivers notes that
&ldquo;once a year there is a definite ceremony, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>in which
the Todas go to the Kota village with which they are connected, taking
an offering of clarified butter, and receiving in return an offering of
grain from the Kotas. I only obtained an account of this ceremony as
performed between the people of Kars and the Kota village of Tizgudr,
and I do not know whether the details would be the same in other cases.
In the Kars ceremony, the Todas go on the appointed day to the Kota
village, headed by a man carrying the clarified butter. Outside the
village they are met by two Kota priests whom the Todas call teupuli,
who bring with them a dairy vessel of the kind the Todas call mu, which
is filled with patm grain. Other Kotas follow with music. All stand
outside the village, and one of the Kotas puts ten measures (kwa) of
patm into the pocket of the cloak of the leading Toda, and the teupuli
give the mu filled with the same grain. The teupuli then go to their
temple and return, each bringing a mu, and the clarified butter brought
by the Todas is divided into two equal parts, and half is poured into
each mu. The leading Toda then takes some of the butter, and rubs it on
the heads of the two Kota priests, who prostrate themselves, one at
each foot of the Toda, and the Toda prays as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>May it be well; Kotas two, may it be well; fields flourish may; rain
may; buffalo milk may; disease go may.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Todas then give the two mu containing the clarified
butter to the Kota priests, and he and his companions return home. This
ceremony is obviously one in which the Todas are believed to promote
the prosperity of the Kotas, their crops, and their buffaloes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In another ceremonial relation between Todas and Kotas, the
kw&ograve;drdoni ti (sacred dairy) is especially <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>concerned. The chief annual ceremony of the Kotas
is held about January in honour of the Kota god Kambataraya. In order
that this ceremony may take place, it is essential that there should be
a palol (dairy man) at the kw&ograve;drdoni ti, and at the present time
it is only occupied every year shortly before and during the ceremony.
The palol gives clarified butter to the Kotas, which should be made
from the milk of the arsaiir, the buffaloes of the ti. Some Kotas of
Kotagiri whom I interviewed claimed that these buffaloes belonged to
them, and that something was done by the palol at the kw&ograve;drdoni
ti in connection with the Kambataraya ceremony, but they could not, or
would not, tell me what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making fire by friction (nejk&#333;l), the Kotas employ three
forms of apparatus:&mdash;(1) a vertical stick, and horizontal stick
with sockets and grooves, both made of twigs of <i>Rhodomyrtus
tomentosus</i>; (2) a small piece of the root of <i>Salix
tetrasperma</i> is spliced into a stick, which is rotated in a socket
in a piece of the root of the same tree; (3) a small piece of the root
of this tree, made tapering at each end with a knife or fragment of
bottle glass, is firmly fixed in the wooden handle of a drill. A
shallow cavity and groove are made in a block of the same wood, and a
few crystalline particles from the ground are dropped into the cavity.
The block is placed on several layers of cotton cloth, on which chips
of wood, broken up small by crushing them in the palm of the hand, are
piled up round the block in the vicinity of the grove. The handle is,
by means of a half cocoanut shell, pressed firmly down, and twisted
between the palms, or rotated by means of a cord. The incandescent
particles, falling on to the chips, ignite them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a report by Lieutenant Evans, written in 1820, it is stated that
&ldquo;the marriages of this caste (the Kothewars) remind one of what
is called bundling in Wales. The bride and bridegroom being together
for the night, in the morning the bride is questioned by her relatives
whether she is pleased with her husband-elect. If she answers in the
affirmative, it is a marriage; if not, the bridegroom is immediately
discharged, and the lady does not suffer in reputation if she thus
discards half a dozen suitors.&rdquo; The recital of this account,
translated into Tamil, raised a smile on the face of my Kota informant,
who volunteered the following information relating to the betrothal and
marriage ceremonies at the present day. Girls as a rule marry when they
are from twelve to sixteen years old, between which years they reach
the age of puberty. A wife is selected for a lad by his parents,
subject to the consent of the girl&rsquo;s parents; or, if a lad has no
near relatives, the selection is made for him by the villagers.
Betrothal takes place when the girl is a child (eight to ten). The boy
goes, accompanied by his father and mother, to the house where the girl
lives, prostrates himself at the feet of her parents, and, if he is
accepted, presents his future father-in-law with a four-anna piece,
which is understood to represent a larger sum, and seals the contract.
According to Breeks, the boy also makes a present of a birianhana of
gold, and the betrothal ceremony is called balimeddeni (bali, bracelet,
meddeni, I have made). Both betrothal and marriage ceremonies take
place on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday, which are regarded as
auspicious days. The ceremonial in connection with marriage is of a
very simple nature. The bridegroom, accompanied by his relatives,
attends a feast at the house of the bride, and the wedding day is
fixed. On the appointed day the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>bridegroom pays a dowry, ranging
from ten to fifty rupees, to the bride&rsquo;s father, and takes the
girl to his house, where the wedding guests, who have accompanied them,
are feasted. The Kotas as a rule have only one wife, and polyandry is
unknown among them. But polygamy is sometimes practiced. My informant,
for example, had two wives, of whom the first had only presented him
with a daughter, and, as he was anxious to have a son, he had taken to
himself a second wife. If a woman bears no children, her husband may
marry a second, or even a third wife; and, if they can get on together
without fighting, all the wives may live under the same roof.</p>
<p>Divorce may, I was told, be obtained for incompatibility of temper,
drunkenness, or immorality; and a man can get rid of his wife &lsquo;if
she is of no use to him&rsquo;, <i>i.e.</i>, if she does not feed him
well, or assist him in the cultivation of his land. Divorce is decided
by a panch&#257;yat (council) of representative villagers, and judgment
given, after the evidence has been taken, by an elder of the community.
Cases of theft, assault, or other mild offence, are also settled by a
panch&#257;yat, and, in the event of a case arising which cannot be
settled by the members of council representing a single village,
delegates from all the Kota villages meet together. If then a decision
cannot be arrived at, recourse is had to the district court, of which
the Kotas steer clear if possible. At a big panch&#257;yat the headman
(Pittakar) of the Kotas gives the decision, referring, if necessary, to
some &lsquo;sensible member&rsquo; of the council for a second
opinion.</p>
<p>When a married woman is known to be pregnant with her first child,
her husband allows the hair on the head and face to grow long, and
leaves the finger nails <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>uncut. On the birth of the child, he
is under pollution until he sees the next crescent moon, and should
cook his own food and remain at home. At the time of delivery a woman
is removed to a hut (a permanent structure), which is divided into two
rooms called dodda (big) telullu and eda (the other) telullu, which
serve as a lying-in chamber and as a retreat for women at their
menstrual periods. The dodda telullu is exclusively used for
confinements. Menstruating women may occupy either room, if the dodda
telullu is not occupied for the former purpose. They remain in
seclusion for three days, and then pass another day in the raised
verandah of the house, or two days if the husband is a
P&#363;j&#257;ri. A woman, after her first confinement, lives for three
months in the dodda telullu, and, on subsequent occasions, until the
appearance of the crescent moon. She is attended during her confinement
and stay in the hut by an elderly Kota woman. The actual confinement
takes place outside the hut, and, after the child is born, the woman is
bathed, and taken inside. Her husband brings five leafy twigs of five
different thorny plants, and places them separately in a row in front
of the telullu. With each twig a stick of <i>Dodon&aelig;a viscosa</i>,
set alight with fire made by friction, must be placed. The woman,
carrying the baby, has to enter the hut by walking backwards between
the thorny twigs.</p>
<p>A common name for females at Kotagiri is M&#257;di, one of the
synonyms of the goddess K&#257;likai, and, at that village, the first
male child is always called Komuttan (K&#257;matar&#257;ya). At
Sh&#333;l&#363;r and Gudal&#363;r this name is scrupulously avoided, as
the name of the god should not be taken by mortal man. As examples of
nicknames, the following may be cited. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The nickname Chinaman was due to the resemblance of a Kota to the
Chinese, of whom a small colony has squatted on the slopes of the hills
between Naduvatam and Gudal&#363;r.</p>
<p>A few days after my arrival at Kotagiri, the dismal sound of
mourning, to the weird strains of the Kota band, announced that death
reigned in the Kota village. The dead man was a venerable carpenter, of
high position in the community. Soon after daybreak, a detachment of
villagers hastened to convey the tidings of the death to the Kotas of
the neighbouring villages, who arrived on the scene later in the day in
Indian file, men in front and women in the rear. As they drew near the
place of mourning, they all, of one accord, commenced the orthodox
manifestations of grief, and were met by a deputation of villagers
accompanied by the band. Meanwhile a red flag, tied to the top of a
bamboo pole, was hoisted as a signal of death in the village, and a
party had gone off to a glade, some two miles distant, to obtain wood
for the construction of the funeral car (t&#275;ru). The car, when
completed, was an elaborate structure, about eighteen feet in height,
made of wood and bamboo, in four tiers, each with a canopy of turkey
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>red and yellow cloth, and an upper canopy of white
cloth trimmed with red, surmounted by a black umbrella of European
manufacture, decorated with red ribbands. The car was profusely adorned
with red flags and long white streamers, and with young plantain trees
at the base. Tied to the car were a calabash and a bell. During the
construction of the car the corpse remained within the house of the
deceased man, outside which the villagers continued mourning to the
dirge-like music of the band, which plays so prominent a part at the
death ceremonies of both Todas and Kotas. On the completion of the car,
late in the afternoon, it was deposited in front of the house. The
corpse, dressed up in a coloured turban and gaudy coat, with a garland
of flowers round the neck, and two rupees, a half-rupee, and sovereign
gummed on to the forehead, was brought from within the house, lying
face upwards on a cot, and placed beneath the lowest canopy of the car.
Near the head were placed iron implements and a bag of rice, at the
feet a bag of tobacco, and beneath the cot baskets of grain, rice,
cakes, etc. The corpse was covered with cloths offered to it as
presents, and before it those Kotas who were younger than the dead man
prostrated themselves, while those who were older touched the head of
the corpse and bowed to it. Around the car the male members of the
community executed a wild step-dance, keeping time with the music in
the execution of various fantastic movements of the arms and legs.
During the long hours of the night mourning was kept up to the almost
incessant music of the band, and the early morn discovered many of the
villagers in an advanced stage of intoxication. Throughout the morning,
dancing round the car was continued by men, sober and inebriated, with
brief intervals of rest, and a young buffalo was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>slaughtered as a matter of routine form, with no
special ceremonial, in a pen outside the village, by blows on the back
and neck administered with the keen edge of an adze. Towards midday
presents of rice from the relatives of the dead man arrived on the back
of a pony, which was paraded round the car. From a vessel containing
rice and rice water, water was crammed into the mouths of the near
relatives, some of the water poured over their heads, and the remainder
offered to the corpse. At intervals a musket, charged with gunpowder,
which proved later on a dangerous weapon in the hands of an intoxicated
Kota, was let off, and the bell on the car rung. About 2 <span class=
"sc">P.M.</span>, the time announced for the funeral, the cot bearing
the corpse, from the forehead of which the coins had been removed, was
carried to a spot outside the village called the
th&#257;v&#257;chivadam, followed by the widow and a throng of Kotas of
both sexes, young and old. The cot was then set down, and, seated at
some distance from it, the women continued to mourn until the funeral
procession was out of sight, those who could not cry spontaneously
mimicking the expression of woe by contortion of the grief muscles. The
most poignant sorrow was displayed by a man in a state of extreme
intoxication, who sat apart by himself, howling and sobbing, and wound
up by creating considerable disturbance at the burning-ground. Three
young bulls were brought from the village, and led round the corpse. Of
these, two were permitted to escape for the time being, while a vain
attempt, which would have excited the derision of the expert Toda
buffalo-catchers, was made by three men, hanging on to the head and
tail, to steer the third bull up to the head of the corpse. The animal,
however, proving refractory, it was deemed discreet to put an end to
its existence by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>a blow on the poll with the butt-end of an adze,
at some distance from the corpse, which was carried up to it, and made
to salute the dead beast&rsquo;s head with the right hand, in feeble
imitation of the impressive Toda ceremonial. The carcase of the bull
was saluted by a few of the Kota men, and subsequently carried off by
Pariahs. Supported by females, the exhausted widow of the dead man was
dragged up to the corpse, and, lying back beside it, had to submit to
the ordeal of removal of all her jewellery, the heavy brass bangle
being hammered off the wrist, supported on a wooden roller, by
oft-repeated blows with mallet and chisel delivered by a village
blacksmith assisted by a besotten individual noted as a consumer of
twelve grains of opium daily. The ornaments, as removed, were collected
in a basket, to be worn again by the widow after several months. This
revolting ceremony concluded, and a last salutation given by the widow
to her dead husband, arches of bamboo were attached to the cot, which
was covered over with a coloured table-cloth hiding the corpse from
sight. A procession was then formed, composed of the corpse on the cot,
preceded by the car and musicians, and followed by male Kotas and
Badagas, Kota women carrying the baskets of grain, cakes, etc., a
vessel containing fire, and burning camphor. Quickly the procession
marched to the burning-ground beyond the bazar, situated in a valley by
the side of a stream running through a glade in a dense undergrowth of
bracken fern and trailing passion-flower. On arrival at the selected
spot, a number of agile Kotas swarmed up the sides of the car, and
stripped it of its adornments including the umbrella, and a free fight
for the possession of the cloths and flags ensued. The denuded car was
then placed over the corpse, which, deprived of all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>valuable
ornaments and still lying on the cot, had been meanwhile placed, amid a
noisy scene of brawling, on the rapidly constructed funeral pyre.
Around the car faggots of wood, supplied in lieu of wreaths by
different families in the dead man&rsquo;s village as a tribute of
respect, were piled up, and the pyre was lighted with torches kindled
at a fire which was burning on the ground close by. As soon as the pyre
was in a blaze, tobacco, cigars, cloths, and grain were distributed
among those present, and the funeral party dispersed, leaving a few men
behind in charge of the burning corpse, and peace reigned once more in
the Kota village. A few days later, the funeral of an elderly woman
took place with a very similar ceremonial. But, suspended from the
handle of the umbrella on the top of the car, was a rag doll, which in
appearance resembled an Aunt Sally. I was told that, on the day
following the funeral, the smouldering ashes are extinguished with
water, and the ashes, collected together, and buried in a pit, the
situation of which is marked by a heap of stones. A piece of the skull,
wrapped in bracken fronds, is placed between two fragments of an
earthen pot, and deposited in the crevice of a rock or in a chink in a
stone wall.</p>
<p>The Kotas celebrate annually a second funeral ceremony in imitation
of the Todas. For eight days before the day appointed for its
observance, a dance takes place in front of the houses of those Kotas
whose memorial rites are to be celebrated, and three days before they
are performed invitations are issued to the different Kota villages. On
a Sunday night, fire is lighted by friction, and the time is spent in
dancing. On the following day, the relatives of the departed who have
to perform the ceremony purify the open space in front of their houses
with cow-dung. They bring three basketfuls <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>of paddy
(unhusked rice), which are saluted and set down on the cleansed space.
The P&#363;j&#257;ri and the rest of the community, in like manner,
salute the paddy, which is taken inside the house. On the Monday, cots
corresponding in number to that of the deceased whose dry funeral is
being held, are taken to the th&#257;vachivadam, and the fragments of
skulls are laid thereon. Buffaloes (one or more for each skull) are
killed, and a cow is brought near the cots, and, after a piece of skull
has been placed on its horns, sacrificed. A dance takes place around
the cots, which are removed to the burning-ground, and set on fire. The
Kotas spend the night near the th&#257;vachivadam. On the following day
a feast is held, and they return to their homes towards evening, those
who have performed the ceremony breaking a small pot full of water in
front of their houses.</p>
<p>Like the Todas, the Kotas indulge in trials of strength with heavy
spherical stones, which they raise, or attempt to raise, from the
ground to the shoulders, and in a game resembling tip-cat. In another
game, sides are chosen, of about ten on each side. One side takes shots
with a ball made of cloth at a brick propped up against a wall, near
which the other side stands. Each man is allowed three shots at the
brick. If it is hit and falls over, one of the &lsquo;out-side&rsquo;
picks up the ball, and throws it at the other side, who run away, and
try to avoid being hit. If the ball touches one of them, the side is
put out, and the other side goes in. A game, called hulikot&#275;,
which bears a resemblance to the English child&rsquo;s game of fox and
geese, is played on a stone chiselled with lines, which forms a rude
game-board. In one form of the game, two tigers and twenty-five bulls,
and in another three tigers and fifteen bulls engage, and the object is
for the tigers to take, or, as the Kotas express it, kill all the
bulls. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>a further game, called kot&#275;, a labyrinthiform
pattern, or maze, is chiselled on a stone, to get to the centre of
which is the problem.</p>
<p>The following notes are taken from my case-book:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Man&mdash;Blacksmith and carpenter. Silver bangle on
right wrist; two silver rings on right little finger; silver ring on
each first toe. Gold ear-rings. Lang&#363;ti (cloth) tied to silver
chain round loins.</p>
<p>Man&mdash;Light blue eyes, inherited from his mother. His children
have eyes of the same colour. Lobes of ears pendulous from heavy gold
ear-rings set with pearls. Another man with light blue eyes was noticed
by me.</p>
<p>Man&mdash;Branded with cicatrix of a burn made with a burning cloth
across lower end of back of forearm. This is a distinguishing mark of
the Kotas, and is made on boys when they are more than eight years
old.</p>
<p>Woman&mdash;Divorced for being a confirmed opium-eater, and living
with her father.</p>
<p>Woman&mdash;Dirty cotton cloth, with blue and red stripes, covering
body and reaching below the knees.</p>
<p>Woman&mdash;Two glass bead necklets, and bead necklet ornamented
with silver rings. Four brass rings, and one steel ring on left
forearm. Two massive brass bangles, weighing two pounds each, and
separated by cloth ring, on right wrist. Brass bangle with brass and
steel pendants, and shell bangle on left wrist. Two steel rings, and
one copper ring on right ring-finger; brass rings on left first, ring,
and little fingers. Two brass rings on first toe of each foot. Tattooed
lines uniting eyebrows. Tattooed on outer side of both upper arms with
rings, dots, and lines; rows of dots on back of right forearm; circle
on back of each wrist; rows of dots on left ankle. As with the Todas,
the tattooed devices are far less elaborate than those of the women in
the plains. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=

<p>Woman&mdash;Glass necklet ornamented with cowry shells, and charm
pendant from it, consisting of a fragment of the root of some tree
rolled up in a ball of cloth. She put it on when her baby was quite
young, to protect it against devils. The baby had a similar charm round
its neck.</p>

<p>In the course of his investigation of the Todas, Dr. Rivers found
that of 320 males 41 or <span class="corr" id="xd21e850" title=
"Source: 8">12.8</span> per cent. and of 183 females only two or 1.1
per cent. were typical examples of red-green colour-blindness. The
percentage in the males is quite remarkable. The result of examination
of Badaga and Kota males by myself with Holmgren&rsquo;s wools was that
red-green colour-blindness was found to be present in 6 out of 246
Badagas, or 2&middot;5 per cent. and there was no suspicion of such
colour-blindness in 121 Kotas.</p>

confined to the Kad&#363;r district. According to a current legend,

<p><b>Kotippattan.</b>&mdash;The <span class="corr" id="xd21e883"
title="Source: Kotippatans">Kotippattans</span> are described, in the
Travancore Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a class of Tamil
Br&#257;hmans, who, at a very early age in Malabar history, were
declared by society to have lost the original Br&#257;hmanical status.
The offence was, it is said, their having taken to the cultivation of
the betel-vine as their chief occupation. The ordinances of caste had
prescribed other duties for the Br&#257;hmans, and it is not unlikely
that Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, to whose curse the present position of
the Kotippattan is traced, disapproved of the change. In general
appearance as regards thread, position of hair-tuft, and dress of men
as well as women, and in ceremonials, the Kotippattans cannot be easily
distinguished from the Br&#257;hman class. Sad instances have occurred
of Br&#257;hman girls having been decoyed into matrimonial alliances
with <span class="corr" id="xd21e886" title=
"Source: Kotipattans">Kotippattans</span>. They form a small community,
and the state of social isolation into which they have been thrown has
greatly checked their increase, as in the case of many other Malabar
castes. Their priests are at present Tamil Br&#257;hmans. They do not
study the V&#275;das, and the G&#257;yatri hymn is recited with the
first syllable known as the pranavam. In the matter of funeral
ceremonies, a Kotippattan is treated as a person excommunicated. The
cremation is a mere mechanical process, unaccompanied by any mantras
(sacred formul&aelig;) or by any rites, anantarasamsk&#257;ra (deferred
funeral rites) being done after the lapse of ten days. They have their
annual sr&#257;ddhas, but no offerings of water (tarpanam) on the
new-moon day. Their household deity is S&#257;sta. Their inheritance is
from father to son. Their household language is Malay&#257;lam. Their
chief seat is V&#257;manapuram, twenty miles from
Trivandrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Kotlu</b> (cow-shed).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Y&#257;n&#257;di. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"

<p><b>K&#333;ttaipaththu.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Agamudaiyans, who
believe that they are the same as the K&#333;ttai (fort) Vell&#257;las
of Tinnevelly.</p>
<p><b>K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;la.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;The K&#333;ttai
Vell&#257;las,&rdquo; Mr. J. A. Boyle writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e902src" href="#xd21e902" name="xd21e902src">16</a> have been
&ldquo;shut up within narrow walls, the others between two rivers. The
result of insulation has been the same, and they have developed from
small families into small, but perfectly distinct, castes. In the
centre of the town of Sr&#299;vaiguntam, in the Tinnevelly district, is
a small fort, composed of a mud enclosure, containing the houses of a
number of families known as K&#333;ttai (fort) Vell&#257;las, who are
separated from social intercourse and intermarriage with other families
of the great Vell&#257;la caste. The traditional origin of this
settlement is dated nearly a thousand years ago, when their ancestors
were driven by a political revolution from their home in the valley of
the Veigay (the river which flows past Madura). Under the P&#257;ndya
dynasty of Madura, these Vell&#257;las were, they allege, the
chamberlains or treasurers, to whom belonged the hereditary dignity of
crowning the newly-succeeded kings. And this is still commemorated by
an annual ceremony, performed in one of the Tinnevelly temples, whither
the heads of families still repair, and crown the head of the
sw&#257;mi (god). Their women never leave the precincts of the mud
enclosure. After seven years of age, no girl is allowed to pass the
gates, and the restriction is supported by the tradition of a
disobedient little girl, who was murdered for a thoughtless breach of
this law. Into the fort no male stranger may enter, though there is no
hindrance to women of other castes to enter. After marriage, no woman
of the caste may be seen by man&rsquo;s eyes, except those of her
husband, father, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>brothers, and maternal uncles. When the census was
taken, they refused to say how many women there were inside the fort,
and infanticide is not only possible, but most probable; for there is a
suspicious absence of increase in the colony, which suggests some mode
of disposing of the &lsquo;useless mouths,&rsquo; unknown to health
officers and policemen. Until recent times, housed within the fort,
were certain pr&aelig;dial slaves (Kottar, smiths) of inferior social
status, who worked for their masters, and lived in the same rigid
seclusion as regards their women. They have been turned out, to live
beyond the enclosure, but work for their masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that, during the days of oppression at the hands of
Muhammadan and Poligar rulers, the K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;las had to pay
considerable sums of money to secure immunity from molestation. The
K&#333;ttai Pillai, or headman of the community, is reported to possess
the grants made from time to time by the rulers of the country,
guaranteeing them the enjoyment of their customs and privileges. The
fort, in which the K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;las live, is kept in good
preservation by Government. There are four entrances, of which one is
kept closed, because, it is said, on one occasion, a child who went out
by it to witness the procession of a god was killed. Br&#257;hmans who
are attached to the fort, male members of various castes who work for
the inmates thereof, and Pallans may freely enter it. But, if any one
wishes to speak to a man living in the fort, the Paraiyan gatekeeper
announces the presence of the visitor. Females of all castes may go
into the fort, and into the houses within it.</p>
<p>On marriage and other festive occasions, it is customary for the
K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;las to give raw rations to those invited, instead
of, as among other castes, a dinner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>The Kottans eat and drink
at the expense of their masters, and dance.</p>
<p>Like the Nang&#363;di Vell&#257;las (Savalai Pillais), the
K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;las have kilais (septs) running in the female
line, and they closely follow them in their marriage customs. It is
usual for a man to marry his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. The
bridegroom goes in state, with his and the bride&rsquo;s relations and
their respective Kottans, to the bride&rsquo;s house. Arrived at the
marriage pandal (booth), they are welcomed by the bride&rsquo;s party.
The h&#333;mam (sacrificial fire) is then raised by the officiating
Br&#257;hman priest, who blesses the t&#257;li (marriage badge), and
hands it to a Kottan female, who passes it on to the elder sister of
the bridegroom, or, if he has no such sister, to a female who takes her
place. She takes it inside the house, and ties it on the neck of the
bride, who has remained within during the ceremony. The contracting
couple are then man and wife. The husband goes to live with his wife,
who, after marriage, continues to live in her father&rsquo;s house. On
the death of her father, she receives half of a brother&rsquo;s share
of the property. If she has no brothers, she inherits the whole
property.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e916src" href="#xd21e916" name=
"xd21e916src">17</a></p>
<p>K&#333;ttai Vell&#257;la women wear ordinary jewels up to middle
life, when they replace them by a jewel called n&#257;gapadam, which is
a gold plate with the representation of a five-headed cobra. This is
said to be worn in memory of the occasion when a P&#257;ndyan king,
named Thennavar&#257;yan, overlooking the claims of his legitimate son,
gave the kingdom to an illegitimate son. The fort Vell&#257;las living
at Sezhuvaim&#257;nagaram refused to place the crown on the
bastard&rsquo;s head. They were consequently persecuted, and had to
leave the country. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>decided to throw themselves into a
fire-pit, and so meet their death in a body. But, just as they were
about to do so, they were prevented by a huge five-headed cobra.
Hearing of this marvellous occurrence, the P&#257;ndyan king who was
ruling in Tinnevelly invited them to settle at Sr&#299;vaiguntam. The
fort Vell&#257;las claim that one of the P&#257;ndyan kings gave them
extensive lands on the bank of the Vaigai river when they lived at
Sezhuvaim&#257;nagaram. They claim further that the ministers and
treasurers of the P&#257;ndyan kings were selected from among them.</p>
<p>The dead are usually cremated. The corpses are borne by Kottans, who
carry out various details in connection with the death ceremonies. The
corpses of women are placed in a bag, which is carefully sewn up.</p>
<p>I am informed that, owing to the scarcity of females, men are at the
present day obliged to recruit wives from outside.</p>

said to belong to the great G&#333;nd family, and, when a man of
another caste wishes to be abusive to a Koyi, he calls him a
G&#333;ndia. The Koyi language is said by Grierson to be a dialect of
G&#333;ndi. Writing concerning the Koyis of the God&#257;vari district,
the Rev. J. Cain states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e985src" href=
"#xd21e985" name="xd21e985src">18</a> that &ldquo;in these parts the

Bustar. A few years ago, when Colonel Haig travelled as far as
Jagdalpuram, the Kois from the neighbourhood of Dummagudem who
accompanied him were frequently unable to carry on any conversation
with many of the Kois on this plateau. There are often slight
differences in the phraseology of the inhabitants of two villages
within a mile of each other. When two of my teachers, living not more
than a mile apart, were collecting vocabularies in the villages in
which they lived, they complained that their vocabularies often
differed in points where they expected to find no variety
whatever.&rdquo; A partial vocabulary of the Koyi language is given by
the Rev. J. Cain, who notes that all the words borrowed from Telugu
take purely Koi terminations in the plural. &ldquo;Its
connection,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;with the Gond language is very
apparent, and also the influence of its neighbour Telugu. This latter
will account for many of the irregularities, which would probably
disappear in the language spoken by the Kois living further away from
the Telugu country.&rdquo; Mr. G. F. Paddison informs me that all the
G&#333;nds whom he met with in the Vizagapatam district were bholo
l&#333;ko (good caste), and would not touch pork or mutton, whereas the
Koyi shares with the D&#333;mbs the distinction of eating anything he
can get in the way of meat, from a rat to a cow. It is noted by Mr. H.
A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e990src" href="#xd21e990" name=
"xd21e990src">19</a> that &ldquo;the Khonds call themselves Kui, a name
identical with Koi or Koya.&rdquo; And, in 1853, an introduction to the
grammar of the Kui or Kandh language was produced by Lingum
Letchmajee.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e993src" href="#xd21e993" name=

<p>It is recorded by the Rev. J. Cain that &ldquo;until the
t&#257;luk&#257;s were handed over to British rule, the
Bhadr&#257;challam Zamindar always kept up a troop of Rohill&#257;s,
who received very little pay for their services, and lived chiefly by
looting the country around. In attendance upon them were one hundred
Kois, and one hundred M&#257;digas. Twenty-five Koi villages form a
samut&#363;, and, in the Bhadr&#257;challam t&#257;luk&#257;, there are
ten samut&#363;s. In the territory on the opposite side of the river,
which also belonged to the Ashwa Rau family, there were ten
samut&#363;s. Each samut&#363; was bound in turn to furnish for a month
a hundred Kois to carry burdens, fetch supplies, etc., for the
above-mentioned Rohill&#257;s. During the month thus employed they had
to provide their own batta (subsistence money). The petty Zamindars of
Albaka, Cherla, Nagar, Bejji and Chintalanada, likewise had their
forces of N&#257;yaks and Kois, and were continually robbing and
plundering. All was grist which came to their mill, even the clothes of
the poor Koi women, who were frequently stripped, and then regarded as
objects of ridicule. The Kois have frequently told me that they could
never lie down to rest without feeling that before morning their
slumbers might be rudely disturbed, their houses burnt, and their
property all carried off. As a rule, they hid their grain in caves and
holes of large trees.&rdquo; It is recorded, in the Vizagapatam Manual,
that, in 1857, the headman of Korat&#363;ru, a village on the
God&#257;vari river, was anxious to obtain a certain rich widow in
marriage for his son. Hearing, however, that she had become the
concubine of a village Munsiff or Magistrate of Buttayag&#363;dem, he
attempted, with a large body of his Koi followers, to carry her off by
force. Failing in the immediate object of his raid, he plundered the
village, and retreated with a quantity of booty and cattle.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

<p>Those Koyis, the Rev. J. Cain writes, who live in the plains
&ldquo;have a tradition that, about two hundred years ago, they were
driven from the plateau in the Bustar country by famine and disputes,
and this relationship is also acknowledged by the Gutta Kois,
<i>i.e.</i>, the hill Kois, who live in the highlands of Bustar. These
call the Kois who live near the God&#257;vari Gommu Kois and
Mayalot&#299;lu. The word Gommu is used to denote the banks and
neighbourhood of the God&#257;vari. Thus, for instance, all the
villages on the banks of the God&#257;vari are called Gommu &#363;llu.
Mayalot&#299;lu means rascal. The Gutta Kois say the lowland Kois
formerly dwelt on the plateau, but on one occasion some of them started
out on a journey to see a Zamindar in the plains, promising to return
before very long. They did not fulfil their promise, but settled in the
plains, and gradually persuaded others to join them, and at times have
secretly visited the plateau on marauding expeditions.... The Kois
regard themselves as being divided into five classes, Perumb&#333;yudu,
Madogutta, Per&#275;gatta, M&#257;tamuppayo, and Vidogutta.&rdquo; The
Rev. J. Cain states further that &ldquo;the lowland Kois say that they
are divided into five tribes, but they do not know the first of these.
The only names they can give are P&#257;redugatta, Mundegutta,
Peramboyina, and Wikaloru, and these tribes are again sub-divided into
many families. The members of the different tribes may intermarry, but
not members of the same tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. F. R. Hemingway<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1007src" href="#xd21e1007" name="xd21e1007src">21</a> that
&ldquo;exogamous septs, called Gattas, occur in the tribe. Among them
are M&#363;d&#333; (third), N&#257;l&#333; (fourth) or Par&#275;di,
Aid&#333; (fifth) or R&#257;yibanda, &#256;r&#333; (sixth),
Nut&#333;muppay&#333; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41"
name="pb41">41</a>]</span>(130th), and Peramb&#333;ya. In some places,
the members of the M&#363;d&#333;, N&#257;l&#333;, and Aid&#333; Gattas
are said to be recognisable by the difference in the marks they
occasionally wear on their foreheads, a spot, a horizontal, and a
perpendicular line respectively being used by them. The &#256;r&#333;
Gatta, however, also uses the perpendicular line.&rdquo; It is further
noted by Mr. Hemingway that the R&#257;cha or Dora Koyas consider
themselves superior to all other sub-divisions, except the Oddis
(superior priests).</p>
<p>It is noted by the Rev. J. Cain that at Gang&#333;lu, a village
about three miles from Dummagudem, &ldquo;live several families who
call themselves B&#257;sava Gollavandlu, but on enquiry I found that
they are really Kois, whose grandfathers had a quarrel with some of
their neighbours, and separated themselves from their old friends. Some
of the present members of the families are anxious to be re-admitted to
the society and privileges of the neighbouring Kois. The word
B&#257;sava is commonly said to be derived from bh&#257;sha, a
language, and the Gollas of that class are said to have been so called
in consequence of their speaking a different language from the rest of
the Gollas. A small but well-known family, the Matta people, are all
said to have been originally Erra Gollas, but six generations ago they
were received into the Koi people. Another well-known family, the
K&#257;ka people, have the following tradition of their arrival in the
Koi districts. Seven men of the Are K&#257;pulu caste of Hindus once
set out on a journey from the neighbourhood of Warangal. Their way led
through dense jungle, and for a very long time they could find no
village, where they and their horses could obtain food and shelter. At
length they espied a small hut belonging to a poor widow, and, riding
up to it, they entered into conversation with her, when they learned
that the whole country was being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>devastated by a nilghai (blue
bull: <i>Boselaphus tragocamelus</i>), which defied all attempts to
capture it. In despair, the king of the country, who was a Koi of the
&#274;mu family, had promised his youngest daughter in marriage to any
man who would rid the country of the pest. Before very long, the
youngest of the K&#257;pus was out wandering in the neighbouring
jungle, and had an encounter with the formidable beast, which ran at
him very fiercely, and attempted to knock him down. The young man
raised a small brass pot, which he was carrying, and struck the animal
so forcible a blow on the head that it fell dead on the spot. He then
cut off its tail, nose, and one ear, and carried them away as trophies
of his victory; and, having hidden his ring in the mutilated head of
the animal, he buried the body in a potter&rsquo;s pit close to the
scene of the encounter. He and his elder brothers then resumed their
journey, but they had not gone far before they received news from the
widow that the potter, hearing of the death of the animal, had gone to
the king with the tidings, and asserted that he himself was the victor,
and was therefore entitled to the promised reward. The king, however,
declined to comply with his request, unless he produced satisfactory
evidence of the truth of the story. The real victor, hearing all this,
bent his steps to the king&rsquo;s court and asserted his claim,
showing his trophies in proof of his statements, and requesting the
king to send and dig up the carcase of the animal, and see whether the
ring was there or not. The king did so, and, finding everything as the
claimant had asserted, he bestowed his daughter on him, and assigned to
the newly married couple suitable quarters in his own house. Before
very long, the next elder brother of the bridegroom came to pay him a
visit, riding in a kachadala, <i>i.e.</i>, a small cart on solid wooden
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>wheels. He found all the city in great trouble in
consequence of the ravages of a crow with an iron beak, with which it
attacked young children, and pecked out their brains. The king, deeply
grieved at his subjects&rsquo; distress, had it proclaimed far and wide
that the slayer of this crow should receive in reward the hand of his
youngest remaining daughter. The young man had with him a new bamboo
bow, and so he fitted an arrow to the string, and let fly at the crow.
His aim was so good that the crow fell dead at once, but the force of
the blow was so great that one of the wings was driven as far south as
the present village of Rekapalli (wing village), its back fell down on
the spot now occupied by Nadampalli (loin or back village), its legs at
K&#257;ls&#257;ram (leg village), and its head at Tirusapuram (head
village), whilst the remainder fell into the cart, and was carried into
the presence of the king. The king was delighted to see such clear
proofs of the young man&rsquo;s bravery, and immediately had the
marriage celebrated, and gave the new son-in-law half the town. He then
made an agreement with his sons-in-law and their friends, according to
which they were in future to give him as many marriageable girls as
could be enclosed and tied up by seven lengths of ropes used for tying
up cattle, and he was to bestow upon them as many as could be tied up
by three lengths. In other words, he was to receive seventy children,
and to give thirty, but this promise has never been fulfilled. The
victor received the name of K&#257;ka (crow), and his descendants are
called the K&#257;ka people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Koyis of the God&#257;vari district are described in the Manual
as being &ldquo;a simple-minded people. They look poor and untidy. The
jungles in which they reside are very unhealthy, and the Kois seem
almost to a man to suffer from chronic fever. They lead an
unsophisticated, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>savage life, and have few ideas, and no knowledge
beyond the daily events of their own little villages; but this
withdrawal from civilised existence is favourable to the growth of
those virtues which are peculiar to a savage life. Like the Khonds,
they are noted for truthfulness, and are quite an example in this
respect to the civilised and more cultivated inhabitants of the plains.
They call themselves Koitors, the latter part of which appellation has
been very easily and naturally changed by the Telugu people, and by the
Kois who come most closely into contact with them, into Dorala, which
means lords; and they are always honoured by this title in the
God&#257;vari district. [The Rev. J. Cain expresses doubts as to the
title Dora being a corruption of tor, and points out that it is a
common title in the Telugu country. Some Koyis on the Bastar plateau
call themselves Bh&#363;mi R&#257;zulu, or kings of the earth.] The
villages are small, but very picturesque. They are built in groups of
five or six houses, in some places even a smaller number, and there are
very rarely so many as ten or fifteen. A clearing is made in the
jungle, and a few acres for cultivation are left vacant round the
houses. In clearing away the wood, every tree is removed except the
ippa (<i>Bassia latifolia</i>) and tamarind trees, which are of the
greatest service to the people on account of their fruit and shade. The
Kois do not remain long in the same place. They are a restless race.
Four years suffice to exhaust the soil in one locality, and they do not
take the trouble to plough deeper, but migrate to another spot, where
they make a fresh clearing, and erect a new village. Their huts are
generally covered with melons and gourds, the flowing tendrils of which
give them a very graceful appearance, but the surrounding jungle makes
them damp and unhealthy. When the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>cultivation season is over, and
the time of harvest draws on, the whole of the village turns out by
families, and lives on the small wooden scaffoldings erected in the
fields, for the purpose of scaring away the wild animals and birds,
which come to feed on the ripening grain. Deer and wild pigs come by
night to steal it, and herds of goats by day. Tigers and cheetas
(leopards) often resort to the fields of Indian corn, and conceal
themselves among the lofty plants. Poorer kinds of grain are also
grown, such as millet and maize, out of which the people make a kind of
porridge, called java. They likewise grow a little cotton, from which
they make some coarse cloth, and tobacco. The ippa tree is much prized.
The Koyis eat the flowers of this tree, which are round and fleshy.
They eat them either dried in the sun, or fried with a little oil. Oil
both for lights and for cooking is obtained from the nut, from which
also an intoxicating spirit is extracted.&rdquo; I gather that the
Koyis further use the oil for anointing the hair, whereas, in Kurnool,
the forest officers barter with the Chenchus for the fruits, which they
will part with, as they do not require them for the toilette or other
purpose.</p>
<p>The cultivation of the Koyis has been described as &ldquo;of the
simplest, most unprofitable kind. A piece of jungle is selected, and
all the trees, except the fruit-bearing ones, are cut down and burned,
the ashes being used for manure. Then, without removing the stumps or
further clearing, the land is scratched along the top, and the seed
sown. For three or four years the natural fertility of the soil yields
them a crop, but then, when the undergrowth begins to appear and the
soil to be impoverished, being too lazy to plough and clean it properly
or to give it manure, they abandon it, and the land again becomes scrub
jungle.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a note on cultivation in the Agency tracts of the God&#257;vari
district, F. R. Hemingway writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1038src" href="#xd21e1038" name="xd21e1038src">22</a> &ldquo;The
majority of the hill Reddis and the Koyas in the Agency carry on
shifting cultivation, called p&#333;du, by burning clearings in the
forests. Two methods prevail: the ordinary (or chalaka) p&#333;du, and
the hill (or konda) p&#333;du. The former consists in cultivating
certain recognised clearings for a year or two at a time, allowing the
forest to grow again for a few years, and then again burning and
cultivating them; while, under the latter, the clearing is not returned
to for a much longer period, and is sometimes deserted for ever. The
latter is in fashion in the more hilly and wilder parts, while the
former is a step towards civilisation. In February or March, the jungle
trees and bushes are cut down, and spread evenly over the portion to be
cultivated; and, when the hot weather comes on, they are burnt. The
ashes act as a manure, and the cultivators think that the mere heat of
the burning makes the ground productive. The land is ploughed once or
twice in chalaka p&#333;dus before and after sowing, but not at all in
konda p&#333;dus. The seed is sown in June. Hill cholam and s&#257;mai
are the commonest crops. The former is dibbled into the ground. Grain
is usually stored in regular granaries (kottu), or in thatched bamboo
receptacles built on a raised foundation, and called g&#257;di. These
are not found in Bhadr&#257;chalam or the central delta, where a high,
round receptacle made of twisted straw (<i>puri</i>) is used. Grain is
also stored, as elsewhere, in pits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Hemingway that the houses of the Koyis &ldquo;are
made of bamboo, with a thatch of grass or palmyra. They are very
restless, and families change <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>frequently from one village to
another. Before morning, they consult the omens, to see whether the
change will be auspicious or not. Sometimes the hatching of a clutch of
eggs provides the answer, or four grains of four kinds of seed,
representing the prosperity of men, cattle, sheep, and land, are put on
a heap of ashes under a man&rsquo;s bed. Any movement among them during
the night is a bad omen. The Koyas proper are chiefly engaged in
agriculture. Their character is a curious medley. They excite
admiration by their truthfulness and simplicity; contempt by their
drunkenness, listlessness, and want of thrift; amusement by their
stupidity and their combination of timidity and self-importance; and
disgust by their uncanny superstitions and thinly veiled
blood-thirstiness. Their truthfulness is proverbial, though it is said
to be less characteristic than of yore, and they never break their
word. Their drunkenness is largely due to the commonness of the ippa
tree (<i>Bassia latifolia</i>), from the flowers of which strong spirit
is distilled, and is most noticeable when this is blossoming. Their
laziness is notorious, and their stupidity is attested by numerous
stories. One, vouched for by the Rev. J. Cain, relates how some of
them, being despatched with a basket of fruit and a note describing its
contents, and being warned that the note would betray any pilfering,
first buried the note so that it could not see, then abstracted some of
the fruit, afterwards disinterred the note and delivered it and the
basket, and were quite at a loss, when charged with the theft, to know
how the note could have learnt about it. They are terribly victimised
by traders and money-lenders from the low country, who take advantage
of their stupidity to cheat them in every conceivable way. Their
timidity has on occasions driven them to seek refuge in the jungle on
the appearance of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Hindu in clean clothes, but, on the other
hand, they insist upon, and receive a considerable measure of respect
from lowlanders whom they encounter. They are perfectly aware that
their title Dora means lord, and they insist upon being given it. They
tolerate the address &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; (m&#257;m&#257;) from their
neighbours of other castes, but they are greatly insulted if called
Koyas. When so addressed, they have sometimes replied &lsquo;Whose
throat have I cut?&rsquo; playing on the word koya, which means to
slice, or cut the throat. When driven to extremes, they are capable of
much courage. Blood feuds have only recently become uncommon in British
territory, and in 1876 flourished greatly in the Bastar
State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the marriage custom of the Koyis the Rev. J. Cain writes
that &ldquo;the Koyis generally marry when of fair age, but infant
marriage is unknown. The maternal uncle of a girl has always the right
to dispose of her hand, which he frequently bestows upon one of his own
sons. If the would-be bridegroom is comparatively wealthy, he can
easily secure a bride by a peaceable arrangement with her parents; but,
if too poor to do this, he consults with his parents and friends, and,
having fixed upon a suitable young girl, he sends his father and
friends to take counsel with the headman of the village where his
future partner resides. A judicious and liberal bestowal of a few
rupees and arak (liquor) obtain the consent of the guardian of the
village to the proposed marriage. This done, the party watch for a
favourable opportunity to carry off the bride, which is sure to occur
when she comes outside her village to fetch water or wood, or, it may
be, when her parents and friends are away, and she is left alone in the
house. The bridegroom generally anxiously awaits the return
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>home of his friends with their captive, and the
ceremony is proceeded with that evening, due notice having been sent to
the bereaved parents. Some of the Koyis are polygamists, and it not
unfrequently happens that a widow is chosen and carried off, it may be
a day or two after the death of her husband, whilst she is still
grieving on account of her loss. The bride and bridegroom are not
always married in the same way. The more simple ceremony is that of
causing the woman to bend her head down, and then, having made the man
lean over her, the friends pour water on his head, and, when the water
has run off his head to that of the woman, they are regarded as man and
wife. The water is generally poured out of a bottle-gourd. (These
gourds are used by the Koyis as bottles, in which they carry drinking
water when on a journey. Very few Koyis stir far from their homes
without one of these filled with water.) Generally, on this
all-important occasion, the two are brought together, and, having
promised to be faithful to each other, drink some milk. Some rice is
then placed before them, and, having again renewed their promises, they
eat the rice. They then go outside the house, and march round a low
heap of earth which has been thrown up under a small pandal (booth)
erected for the occasion, singing a simple love song as they proceed.
Afterwards they pay their respects to the elders present, and beg for
their blessing, which is generally bestowed in the form of &lsquo;May
you be happy! may you not fight and quarrel!&rsquo; etc. This over, all
present fall to the task of devouring the quantity of provisions
provided for the occasion, and, having well eaten and drunk, the
ceremony is concluded. If the happy couple and their friends are
comparatively wealthy, the festivities last several days. Dancing and
singing are kept up every evening, and, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>when the fun waxes fast
and furious, the mother-in-law takes up her new son-in-law on her
shoulders, and his mother her new daughter-in-law, and dance round as
vigorously as age and strength permit. If the mothers-in-law are not
able, it is the duty of the respective maternal aunts to perform this
ludicrous office. When the bridegroom is a fine strapping young man,
this is a duty rather than a pleasure. Some do not object to run away
with the wife of another man, and, in former years, a husband has been
known to have been murdered for the sake of his wife. Even at present,
more disputes arise from bride-stealing than from any other cause,
especially as up to the present time (1876) the Government officials
have not been able to stop this practice. In the case of a man running
away with another man&rsquo;s wife, the samatu dora (headman), on its
being reported to him, goes to the village where the culprit lives,
assembles the headman, and calls the offender before him. He then fines
the man twelve rupees, and orders him to give another twelve to the
husband of the woman whom he has stolen, and then demands two
rupees&rsquo; worth of liquor, a goat, and grain for a feast. On these
being brought, the night is spent in feasting and drinking, and the
fault is forgiven. In cases of breach of the seventh commandment, the
offender is often placed between two logs of wood, upon which as many
men sit as can be accommodated, and press it down as long as they can
without endangering the unfortunate man&rsquo;s life. In all the Koi
villages there is a large house, where the young unmarried men have to
sleep, and another which the young unmarried girls have to occupy at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Hemingway that, &ldquo;if a Koya youth is refused
by the maiden of his choice, he generally carries her off by force. But
a boy can reserve a girl <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href=
"#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>baby for himself by giving the mother
a pot, and a cloth for the baby to lie upon, and then she may not be
carried off. Girls who consort with a man of low caste are purified by
having their tongues branded with a hot golden needle, and by being
made to pass through seven arches of palmyra leaves which are
afterwards burnt.&rdquo; (<i>cf.</i> Koraga.) According to Mr. R. E.
Enthoven,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1067src" href="#xd21e1067" name=
"xd21e1067src">23</a> &ldquo;the suggestion seems to be a rapid
representation of seven existences, the outcast regaining his (or her)
status after seven generations have passed without further
transgression. The parallel suggested is the law of Manu that seven
generations are necessary to efface a lapse from the law of endogamous
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on marriage among the Koyis of Vizagapatam, Mr. C.
Hayavadana Rao writes that the parents and other relations of the
bridegroom go to the bride&rsquo;s home with a present (v&#333;li) of
three or four head-loads of fermented liquor made from r&#257;gi
(<i>Eleusine Coracana</i>) seeds, a pair of new cloths for the
girl&rsquo;s father and mother, and a pig. A feast is held, and, on the
following day, the bride is conducted to the home of the bridegroom.
The marriage ceremony is then conducted on lines similar to those
already described.</p>
<p>In connection with birth ceremonies, the Rev. J. Cain writes that
&ldquo;the Koi women are very hardy, and careless about themselves.
After the birth of a child, they do not indulge in the luxury of a cot,
but, according to their usual custom, continue to lie upon the ground,
bathe in cold water, and eat their accustomed food. Directly the child
is born, it is placed upon a cot, and the mother resumes her ordinary
work of fetching water, wood, leaves, etc., cooking for the family, and
so on. On the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>seventh day the child is well washed, and all the
neighbours and near relatives assemble together to name the child.
Having placed the child on a cot, they put a leaf of the mohwa tree
(<i>Bassia</i>) in the child&rsquo;s hand, and pronounce some name
which they think suitable. If the child closes its hand over the leaf,
it is regarded as a sign that the child acquiesces, but, if the child
rejects the leaf or cries, they take it as a sign that they must choose
another name, and so they throw away the leaf, and substitute another
leaf and another name, until the child shows its approbation. If the
name chosen is that of any person present, the owner of that name
generally expresses his appreciation of the honour thus conferred by
placing a small coin in the hand of the child, otherwise the father is
bound to do so. This ceremony is followed by a night of dancing and
singing, and the next day the father gives a feast to his neighbours
and friends, or, if too poor for that, treats the male friends to
liquor. Most Kois now name their children without all the elaborate
ceremonial mentioned above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bodies of children,&rdquo; the Rev. J. Cain writes,
&ldquo;and of young men and young women are buried. If a child dies
within a month of its birth, it is usually buried close to the house,
so that the rain dropping from the eaves may fall upon the grave, and
thereby cause the parents to be blessed with another child in due
course of time. With the exception of the above mentioned, corpses are
usually burnt. A cow or bullock is slain, and the tail cut off and put
in the dead person&rsquo;s hand, after the cot on which the corpse is
carried has been placed upon the funeral pile. If a p&#363;j&#257;ri,
or Koi priest, is present, he not unfrequently claims a cloth or two
belonging to the dead person. The cot is then removed, and the body
burnt. Mr. Vanstavern reports having seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>part of the liver of the
slain animal placed in the mouth of the corpse. The friends of the
deceased retire, and proceed to feast upon the animal slain for the
occasion. Three days afterwards they generally return, bringing
contributions of ch&#333;lam (grain), and, having slain one or more
animals, have a second feast. In some parts, immediately after the
corpse is consumed, the ashes are wetted, rolled into balls, and
deposited in a hole about two feet deep, dug on the roadside just
outside their village. Over the hole is placed a slab of stone, and at
the head an upright stone, and, whenever friends pass by these
monuments, they endeavour to place a few leaves of tobacco on the
slabs, remarking at the same time how fond the deceased were of tobacco
in their lifetime. The hill Kois have erected very large slabs in days
gone by, and it is not uncommon to see rows of ten to fifteen outside
the villages close to well-frequented roads, but at present they seldom
take the trouble to put up any monuments. In the Malkanagiri
t&#257;luk, the Kois every now and then erect these stones, and, when
encamped in a village, we were struck by the height of one, from the
top of which was suspended an ox tail. On enquiry we found that it was
the tomb of the late headman, who had been enterprising enough to build
some large bunds (embankments), and thus improve his rice fields.
Success attended his efforts, and five crops rewarded him. But, alas,
envious persons plotted his downfall, he became ill, and called in the
diviner, who soon discovered the cause of the fatal illness in the
shape of balls of mud, which had been surreptitiously introduced into
his stomach by some demoness at the instigation of some foes. Three
days after the funeral feast, a second one is frequently held, and, if
means are forthcoming, another on the seventh and fifteenth days. The
nights are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>always spent in dancing to the beating of the
tom-tom or drum. All believe that these feasts are necessary for the
repose of the spirits of the deceased, and that, if these are not thus
duly honoured, they will wander about the jungle in the form of
pis&#257;chas (devils) ready to avenge their friends&rsquo; neglect of
their comfort by bringing evil upon their children or cattle. If they
are not satisfied as to the cause of the death of any of their friends,
they continue to meet at intervals for a whole year, offer the
sacrificial feasts, and inquire of the diviner whether he thinks that
the spirit of the deceased has been able to associate with spirits or
its predeceased friends, and, when they obtain an answer in the
affirmative, then and then only do they discontinue these
feasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with death ceremonies, Mr. Hemingway notes that
&ldquo;when a Koya dies, a cow or bullock is slaughtered, and the tail
is cut off, and put in the dead man&rsquo;s hand. The liver is said to
be sometimes put in his mouth. His widow&rsquo;s t&#257;li (marriage
badge) is always placed there, and, when a married woman dies, her
t&#257;li is put in her mouth. The pyre of a man is lighted by his
nephew, and of a woman by her son. No pollution is observed by those
attending the funeral. The beef of the slain animal provides a feast,
and the whole party returns home and makes merry. On the eighth day, a
pot of water is placed in the dead man&rsquo;s house for him to drink,
and is watched by his nephew. Next morning another cow is slaughtered,
and the tail and a ball of cooked rice are offered to the soul at the
burning ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the death ceremonies in the Vizagapatam district, Mr. C.
Hayavadana Rao writes that the corpses of young children are buried far
away from the home of their parents. It is customary, among the more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>prosperous families, to put a few rupees into the
mouth of a corpse before the funeral pyre is lighted. The money is made
to represent the value of the animal sacrificed in the God&#257;vari
district. Death pollution is not observed, but on the eighth day the
relations kill a fowl, and burn it at the spot where the body was
cremated. The ashes of a dead person are carried to a spot set apart
close to the highway. Water is poured over them, and they are made into
small balls. A hole, two or three feet deep, is dug, into which the
balls, a few of the pots belonging to the deceased, and some money are
put. They are covered over with a stone slab, at one end of which an
upright slab is set up. A cow is killed, and its tail cut off, and tied
to the upright slab, to appease the ghost of the dead person. The
remainder of the animal is carried off, and used for a feast.
Gh&#257;sias are notorious for opening up these Koyi sepulchres, and
stealing the money buried in them.</p>
<p>Mr. H. Tyler informs me that he came across the burning funeral pyre
of a Koyi girl, who had died of syphilis. Across a neighbouring path
leading to the Koyi village, were a basket fish-trap containing grass,
and on each side thorny twigs, which were intended to catch the malign
spirit of the dead girl, and prevent it from entering the village. The
twigs and trap, containing the captured spirit, were to be burnt by the
Koyis on the following day.</p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Hemingway that &ldquo;people who are neither good
enough for heaven, nor bad enough for hell, are born again in their
former family. Children with hare-lip, moles, etc., are often
identified as re-incarnations of deceased relations. Tattooing is
common. It is, for various reasons, considered very important for the
soul in the next world that the body should have been adequately
tattooed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the Koyis, the Rev. J. Cain writes that
they say &ldquo;that the following gods and goddesses were appointed to
be worshipped by Sudras:&mdash;Muttelamma, Maridimah&#257;lakshmi,
Potur&#257;zu and Korr&#257;zulu; and the following were to receive
adoration from the Koyis:&mdash;Kommalamma, K&#257;tur&#363;du,
Adamar&#257;zu. The goddess M&#257;mili or P&#275;le must be
propitiated early in the year, or else the crops will undoubtedly fail;
and she is said to be very partial to human victims. There is strong
reason to think that two men were murdered in 1876 near a village not
far from Dummagudem, as offerings to this d&#275;vata, and there is no
reason to doubt that every year strangers are quietly put out of the
way in the Bastar country, to ensure the favour of this blood-thirsty
goddess. All the Koyis seem to hold in great respect the P&#257;ndava
brothers, especially Arjuna and Bh&#299;ma. The wild dogs or dhols are
regarded as the d&#363;tas or messengers of these brothers, and the
long black beetles which appear in large numbers at the beginning of
the hot weather are called the P&#257;ndava flock of goats. Of course
they would on no account attempt to kill a dhol, even though it should
happen to attack their favourite calf, and they even regard it as
imprudent to interfere with these d&#363;tas, when they wish to feast
upon their cattle.&rdquo; The tradition among the Koyis is that, when
the P&#257;ndava brothers were in exile, Bh&#299;ma, whom they call
Bh&#299;mador, went hunting in the jungle, and met a wild woman of the
woods, whom he fell in love with and married. The fruit of this union
was the Koyi people. The tradition further states that this wild woman
was not a human being.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1101src" href=
"#xd21e1101" name="xd21e1101src">24</a> &ldquo;A Koi,&rdquo; the Rev.
J. Cain continues, &ldquo;whom Mr. Alexander met in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>village
about two miles from Dummagudem, caused him to infer that the Kois
think heaven to be a great fort, and in it plenty of rice to eat for
those who enter it; that hell is a dismal place, where a crow, made of
iron, continually gnaws off the flesh of the wicked. This must have
been that particular Koi&rsquo;s own peculiar belief, for it certainly
is not that of any of the Kois with whom I so frequently come in
contact. The mention of the iron crow reminds me that, about two years
ago, a rumour rapidly spread in some of the villages that an iron cock
was abroad very early in the morning, and upon the first village in
which it heard one or more cocks begin to crow it would send a grievous
pestilence, and at least decimate the village. In one instance at
least, this led to immediate extermination of all the unfortunate cocks
in that village. Last year (1878) the inhabitants of a village on the
left bank of the God&#257;vari were startled by the tall&#257;ris
(village peons) of the neighbouring village bringing about twenty
fowls, and ordering them to be sent on the next village south of
Dummagudem. On being asked the reason of this order, they replied that
the cholera goddess was selecting her victims in the villages further
north, and that, to induce her to leave their parts, some of these
villages had sent these fowls as offerings to her, but they were to be
passed on as far as possible before they were slain, for then she would
follow in anticipation of the feast, and so might be tempted quite out
of these regions. The Police, however, interfered, and they were passed
back into the Upper God&#257;vari district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing further concerning the religion of the Koyis, the Rev. J.
Cain adds that &ldquo;one Sunday afternoon, some Kois came to us from a
village nine miles away, and begged for medicine for a man, whose right
cheek, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>they said, had been torn away by a tiger, just as
if it had been cut out by a knife. A few days afterwards we heard a
story, which was far more credible. The people of the village were very
anxious for good crops, and resolved to return to the practice of
offering a stranger passing by to the goddess M&#257;mili, and so two
of them were on the look-out for a victim. They soon saw one, and began
to pursue him, but he, a Koi, knowing the former evil repute of the
village, suspected their design and fled, and at last took refuge up a
manchan. They began to ascend too, when he took out of his belt a
knife, and struck at his assailants, and cut away his right cheek. This
caused the two assailants to retreat, and the man escaped. As human
sacrifices are now illegal, a langur monkey is frequently substituted,
and called for occasion Ekuromma Potu, <i>i.e.</i>, a male with small
breasts. This name is given in the hope of persuading the goddess that
she is receiving a human sacrifice. Mutyalamma is the goddess, who is
supposed to preside over small-pox and cholera. When the villages have
determined to appease this dread goddess, they erect a pandal (booth)
outside their village under a n&#299;m (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) tree,
search all round for the soft earth of a white-ant heap, and proceed at
once to mould this earth into the form of an image of a woman, tie a
cloth or two round her, hang a few peacock&rsquo;s feathers around her
neck, and place her under the pandal on a three-legged stool, which has
been made of the wood of <i>Cochlospermum Gossypium</i> (silk-cotton
tree) for the occasion. They then bring forward a chicken and try to
persuade it to eat some of the grains they have thrown down before the
image, requesting the goddess to inform them whether she will leave
their village or not. If the chicken picks up some of the grains, they
regard it as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>most favourable omen, but, if not, their hearts
are immediately filled with dread of the continued anger of the
goddess. They then bring forward two sheep or goats, and then present
to them a dish of toddy, and, if the toddy is drunk by the animals,
they are quite assured of the speedy departure of the plague which is
devastating their village. The sheep are then tied up till the next
morning. In the meantime a sorcerer is brought to the front, and they
enquire of him the determination of the goddess. After this they return
to the village, and they all drink well, and the night is spent in
dancing, in which the women join. The next morning the pandal and its
inmate are removed to a site still farther away from the village, after
which the fowl is killed over the image, on which some drops of blood
are allowed to fall. The sheep then have garlands hung round their
necks, and their heads are adorned with turmeric, and pots of cold
water are poured over them. The deity is at the same time again asked
whether she intends to leave them alone, and, if she is disposed to be
favourable towards them, she replies by causing the sheep to shiver.
The animals are immediately killed, the left ear and left leg being cut
off and placed in the mouth, and the head cut off and left as an
offering before the image. The rest of the sacrifice is then carried
away, to be cooked and enjoyed by all the worshippers before they reach
home, as their wives are not allowed to partake of the sacrificial
feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another goddess or demoness, of which many stand in dread, is
called a Pida, and her they propitiate in the month of December. All
the men of the village gather together and collect from each house a
handful of ch&#333;lam, which they give to the wife of the
p&#363;j&#257;ri, directing her to make bread with it for her husband.
After <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>he has partaken of it, they bring pots of warm
water and pour it over his head, and then all in the village spend some
time in dancing. A chatty (pot) is brought after a time, in which are
placed leaves of the <i>Diospyros Embryopteris</i>, and two young men
carry it between them, suspended from a pole cut from the same tree,
all around the village. The p&#363;j&#257;ri, carrying a cock,
accompanies them, and also the rest of the men of the village, each one
carrying a staff cut from the above mentioned tree, with which he
strikes the eaves of each house passed in their perambulations. When
they have been all around the village, they all march off some little
distance, and tie up the stick on which the pot is suspended to two
neighbouring trees, and place their staves close by. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri sets to work to kill the cock, and they all beg the
demoness, whom they suppose to have entered the pot, not to come to
their village again. The p&#363;j&#257;ri then cooks and eats the cock
with food which has been supplied him, and the other worshippers also
satisfy the cravings of hunger with food they have brought with them.
On no account do they return home until after dark, lest the demoness
should see the road to their village, and follow in their wake. Very
frequently on these occasions, votive offerings, promised long before,
are sacrificed and eaten by the p&#363;j&#257;ri. It is not at all
uncommon for a Koi to promise the Pida a seven-horned male
(<i>i.e.</i>, a cock) as a bribe to be let alone, a two-horned male
(<i>i.e.</i>, a goat) being set apart by more wealthy or more fervent
suppliants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kois acknowledge that they worship the d&#275;vatalu or
the dayyamulu (demons of the mountains). The Korra R&#257;zu is
supposed to be the deity who has supreme control over tigers, and a
friend of mine once saw a small temple devoted to his worship a few
miles <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>from the large village of Gollapalli, Bastar, but
it did not seem to be held in very great respect. There is no Koi
temple in any village near Dummagudem, and the Kois are seldom, if
ever, to be found near a Hindu temple. Some time ago there was a small
mud temple to the goddesses Sarlamm&#257; and Kommalamm&#257; at Pedda
Nallapalli, and the head Koi of the village was the p&#363;j&#257;ri,
but he became a Christian, and the temple fell into ruins, and soon
melted away. A few families have added to their own faith the worship
of Siva, and many of them are proud of the appellation of Linga
Kois.&rdquo; &ldquo;In times of drought,&rdquo; Mr. Hemingway writes,
&ldquo;a festival to Bh&#299;ma, which lasts five days, is held. When
rain appears, the Koyis sacrifice a cow or pig to their patron. Dancing
plays an important part at all these feasts, and also at marriages. The
men put on head-dresses of straw, into which buffalo horns are stuck,
and accompany themselves with a kind of chant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; the Rev. J. Cain writes, &ldquo;generally
one v&#275;lpu for each gens, and in a certain village there is the
chief v&#275;lpu for the whole tribe of Kois. When any of the inferior
v&#275;lpus are carried about, contributions in kind or cash are
collected by its guardians almost exclusively from the members of the
gens to which the v&#275;lpu belongs. When the superior v&#275;lpu is
taken to any village, all the inferior v&#275;lpus are brought, and,
with the exception of two, are planted some little distance in front of
their lord. There are two, however, which are regarded as lieutenants
of the paramount power, and these are planted one on each side of their
superior. As it was expressed to me, the chief v&#275;lpu is like the
R&#257;ja of Bastar, these two are like his ministers of state, and the
rest are like the petty zamindars (land-owners) under him. The largest
share of the offerings goes to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>chief, the two supporters then
claim a fair amount, and the remainder is equally divided amongst those
of the third rank.... Ancestral worship prevails among the Kois,
especially on the occasions when the v&#275;lpu of the family is
carried round. The v&#275;lpu is a large three-cornered red cloth, with
a number of figures of various ancestors roughly cut out of different
coloured cloth, white, green, blue, or yellow, and stitched to the main
cloth. Whenever any important male member of the family dies, a new
figure is added to commemorate his services. It is usually kept in the
custody of the leading man of the family, and taken round by him to all
members of that family once a year, when each member is bound to give
an offering to the v&#275;lpu. No one belonging to a different family
takes any part in the ceremonies. On the occasion of its being carried
round, it is fixed to a long bamboo ornamented at the top with the hair
from the tail of a yak, and with loudly sounding brass bells. On
arriving at a village where there are a sufficient number of Kois of
the particular family to make it worth while to stay, the priest in
charge of the v&#275;lpu and his attendant D&#333;li give due notice of
their arrival, and, having planted the v&#275;lpu in the ground, the
night is spent by all the members of the family to which the v&#275;lpu
belongs in dancing and making merry to the sound of the drum, which is
beaten by the D&#333;li only. The priest in charge has to fast all
night, and keep himself ceremonially pure. In the morning they all
proceed to the nearest stream or tank (pond), with the v&#275;lpu in
front carried by the priest, and there bathe, and also enjoy the fun of
sprinkling each other with water to their hearts&rsquo; content. This
done, they come up out of the water, plant the v&#275;lpu on the bank,
and send for the bullock to be sacrificed. When this is brought, its
legs are tied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>together, and it is then thrown on the ground, and
the priest (or, if he is weak, a strong younger man) has to kill it at
one blow. It is then cut up, and, after the attendant priest has
received his share, it is divided amongst the attendant crowd, who
spend the rest of the day in feasting and drinking. As a rule, no act
of obeisance or worship is even paid to the v&#275;lpu, unless the
offering of money to the custodian be regarded as such. Sometimes a
woman very desirous of having a child brings a cock, throws it down
before the v&#275;lpu and makes obeisance to it, but this is not a very
common custom. The D&#333;livandlu or D&#333;lollu always attend the
v&#275;lpu, and are present at all the marriage feasts, when they
recite old stories, and sing national songs. They are not Kois, but
really a section of the M&#257;la caste, although they will not mix
with the rest of the M&#257;las of their own family, excepting when on
the Bastar plateau among the hill Kois. The Kois have very amusing
stories as to how the hair from the tail of the yak is obtained. They
say that the yak is a hairy animal which lives in a country far away,
but that its great peculiarity is that it has only one leg, and that
this leg has no joints in it. Being a very swift animal, it is
impossible to capture it in any ordinary way, but, as it rests at night
by leaning against one particular tree, the hunters carefully mark this
tree, and some time during the day cut the trunk through as far as
advisable, and watch the result. When night comes on, the animal
returns to its resting place, leans against the tree, which is no
longer able to give support to the yak, and both fall to the ground.
The hunters immediately rush in, and seize their prey. A friend has
supplied me with the following reference in &lsquo;De Bello
Gallico.&rsquo; They (the hunters) either undermine all the trees in
that place at the roots, or cut them so far as to leave the external
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>appearance of a standing tree. Then the elk, which
has no knots or joints, comes, leans, as usual, and down comes tree,
elk and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the v&#275;lpus, Mr. Hemingway writes that &ldquo;they
consist of small pieces of metal, generally iron and less than a foot
in length, which are kept in a hollow bamboo deposited in some wild and
unfrequented spot. They are guarded with great secrecy by those in
charge of them, and are only shown to the principal worshippers on the
rare occasions when they are taken out to be adored. The Koyas are very
reticent about them. Mr. Cain says that there is one supreme
v&#275;lpu, which is recognised as the highest by the whole Koya tribe,
and kept hidden in the depths of Bastar. There are also v&#275;lpus for
each gatta, and for each family. The former are considered superior to
the latter, and are less frequently brought out of their retreats. One
of them called Lakk&#257;la (or Lakka) R&#257;mu, which belongs either
to the &#256;ro or Peramb&#333;ya gatta, is considered more potent than
the others. It is ornamented with eyes of gold and silver, and is kept
in a cave near Sit&#257;nagaram in the Bhadr&#257;chalam taluk. The
others are deposited in different places in the Bastar state. They all
have names of their own, but are also known by the generic term
&#256;dama R&#257;zu. Both the gatta and family v&#275;lpus are
worshipped only by members of the sept or family to which they
appertain. They are taken round the country at intervals, to receive
the reverence and gifts of their adherents. The former are brought out
once in every three or four years, especially during widespread
sickness, failure of crops, or cattle disease. An animal (generally a
young bullock) is stabbed under the left shoulder, the blood is
sprinkled over the deity, and the animal is next killed, and its liver
is cut out and offered to the deity. A feast, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>sometimes lasts for two days, takes place, and the
v&#275;lpu is then put back in its hiding-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present,&rdquo; the Rev. J. Cain writes, &ldquo;the Kois
around here (Dummagudem) have very few festivals, except one at the
harvest of the zonna (<i>Sorghum vulgare</i>). Formerly they had one
not only for every grain crop, but one when the ippa flowers were ready
to be gathered, another when the pumpkins were ripe, at the first
tapping of the palm tree for toddy, etc. Now, at the time the zonna
crop is ripe and ready to be cut, they take a fowl into the field, kill
it, and sprinkle its blood on any ordinary stone put up for the
occasion, after which they are at liberty to partake of the new crop.
In many villages they would refuse to eat with any Koi who has
neglected this ceremony, to which they give the name Kottalu, which
word is evidently derived from the Telugu word kotta (new). Rice-straw
cords are hung on trees, to show that the feast has been
observed.&rdquo; In some places, Mr. Hemingway tells us, the victim is
a sheep, and the first fruits are offered to the local gods, and to the
ancestors. Another singular feast occurs soon after the ch&#333;lam
(zonna) crop has been harvested. Early on the morning of that day, all
the men of each village have to turn out into the forest to hunt, and
woe betide the unlucky individual who does not bring home some game, be
it only a bird or a mouse. All the women rush after him with cow-dung,
mud or dirt, and pelt him out of their village, and he does not appear
again in that village until the next morning. The hunter who has been
most successful then parades the village with his game, and receives
presents of paddy (rice) from every house. Mr. Vanstavern, whilst
boring for coal at Beddadanolu, was visited by all the Koi women of the
village, dressed up in their lords&rsquo; clothes, and they told
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>him that they had that morning driven their
husbands to the forest, to bring home game of some kind or other. This
quaint festival is said by Mr. Hemingway to be called Bh&#363;d&#275;vi
Pandaga, or the festival of the earth goddess. When the samalu crop is
ripe, the Kois summon the p&#363;j&#257;ri on a previously appointed
day, and collect from every house in the village a fowl and a handful
of grain. The p&#363;j&#257;ri has to fast all that night, and bathe
early the next morning. After bathing, he kills the fowls gathered the
previous evening in the names of the favourite gods, and fastens an ear
of samalu to each house, and then a feast follows. In the evening they
cook some of the new grain, and kill fresh fowls, which have not to be
curried but roasted, and the heart, liver, and lights of which are set
apart as the especial food of their ancestral spirits, and eaten by
every member of each household in their name. The bean feast is an
important one, as, until it is held, no one is allowed to gather any
beans. On the second day before the feast, the village p&#363;j&#257;ri
must eat only bread. The day before, he must fast the whole twenty-four
hours, and, on the day of the feast, he must eat only rice cooked in
milk, with the bird offered in sacrifice. All the men of the village
accompany the p&#363;j&#257;ri to a neighbouring tree, which must be a
<i>Terminalia tomentosa</i>, and set up a stone, which they thus
dedicate to the goddess Kodalamma. Every one is bound to bring for the
p&#363;j&#257;ri a good hen and a seer of rice, and for himself a cock
and half a seer of rice. The p&#363;j&#257;ri also demands from them
two annas as his sacrificing fee. Each worshipper then brings his cock
to the p&#363;j&#257;ri, who holds it over grains of rice which have
been sprinkled before the goddess, and, if the bird pecks at the rice,
good luck is ensured for the coming year, whilst, if perchance the bird
pecks three times, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>offerer of that particular cock can scarcely
contain himself for joy. If the bird declines to touch the grains, then
ill-luck is sure to visit the owner&rsquo;s house during the ensuing
year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kois have but little belief in death from natural causes.
Some demon or demoness has brought about the death by bringing fever or
small-pox, or some other fell disease, and this frequently at the
instigation of an enemy of the deceased. In days gone-by, the taking of
the ordeal to clear oneself was the common practice, but at present it
is quite the exception. But, if there are very suspicious circumstances
that ill-will has brought about the death, the friends of the deceased
assemble, place the corpse on a cot, and make straight for the
suspected enemy. If he or she is unfortunate enough to be at home, a
trial takes place. A pot is partly filled with water, on the top of
which ghee (clarified butter) and milk are poured, and then it is
placed on the fire. As soon as it begins to boil, stones are thrown in,
and the accused is summoned to take them out. If this is done without
any apparent injury to the unfortunate victim, a verdict of not guilty
is returned; but, if there are signs of the hand being at all scalded
or burnt, the unhappy wight has to eat a bone of the deceased, which is
removed and pounded, and mixed with boiled rice and milk. In days
gone-by, the sentence was death.&rdquo; According to Mr. Hemingway,
when a death occurs, &ldquo;an enquiry is held as to who is guilty.
Some male member of the family, generally the nephew of the deceased,
throws coloured rice over the corpse as it lies stretched on the bed,
pronouncing as he does so the names of all the known sorcerers who live
in the neighbourhood. It is even now solemnly asserted that, when the
name of the wizard responsible is pronounced, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the bed
gets up, and moves towards the house or village where he
resides.&rdquo; &ldquo;For some months,&rdquo; the Rev. J. Cain
continues, &ldquo;a poor old Koi woman was living in our compound,
because she had been driven out of village after village in Bastar from
the suspicion that she was the cause of the death of more than one
relative, and she was afraid that she might fall a victim to their
just(?) vengeance. The fear that some envious person will persuade a
demon to plague them affects their whole life and conduct. Over and
over again we have been told by men and women, when we have
remonstrated with them on account of their scanty attire &lsquo;Yes, it
is quite true that we have abundance of clothes at home, but, if we
were always to wear them, some enemy or other would prevail on a demon
to take possession of us, and kill us.&rsquo; A young Koi was once
employed to teach a few children in his own village, but, alas, ere
long he became unwell of some strange disease, which no medicine could
remove. As a last resource, a diviner was called in, who made a careful
diagnosis of the case, and the illness was declared to have been
brought on by a demoness at the instigation of some enemy, who was
envious of the money which the lad had received for teaching. I once
saw one of these diviners at work, discovering the sickness which had
laid prostrate a strong man. The diviner had in his hand a leaf from an
old palmyra leaf book, and, as he walked round and round the patient,
he pretended to be reading. Then he took up a small stick, and drew a
number of lines on the ground, after which he danced and sang round and
round the sick man, who sat looking at him, evidently much impressed
with his performance. Suddenly he made a dart at the man, and, stooping
down, bit him severely in two or three places in the back. Then,
rushing to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>front, he produced a few grains which he said he
had found in the man&rsquo;s back, and which were evidently the cause
of the sickness. In the case of the young man before mentioned, the
diviner produced a little silver, which he declared to be a sure sign
that the sickness was connected with the silver money he was receiving
for teaching. The diviners have to wear their hair long, like Samson,
and, if it falls off or is cut short, their power is supposed to leave
them.&rdquo; It is noted by Mr. Hemingway that in some parts, when any
one falls ill, the professional sorcerer is consulted, and he reads
both the cause and the remedy in a leaf platter of rice, which he
carries thrice round the invalid.</p>
<p>The name Chedipe (prostitute) is applied to sorceresses among
various classes in the God&#257;vari district. She is believed to ride
on a tiger at night over the boundaries of seven villages, and return
home at early morn. When she does not like a man, she goes to him
bare-bodied at dead of night, the closed doors of the house in which he
is sleeping opening before her. She sucks his blood by putting his toe
in her mouth. He will then be motionless and insensible like a corpse.
Next morning he feels intoxicated, as if he had taken ganja
(<i>Cannabis sativa</i>), and remains in that condition all day. If he
does not take medicine from one skilled in treating such cases, he will
die. If he is properly treated, he will be as well as ever in about ten
days. If he makes no effort to get cured, the Chedipe will molest him
again and again, and, becoming gradually emaciated, he will die. When a
Chedipe enters a house, all those who are awake will become insensible,
those who are seated falling down as if they had taken a soporific
drug. Sometimes she drags out the tongue of the intended victim, who
will die at once. At other times, slight abrasions will be found on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>the skin of the intended victim, and, when the
Chedipe puts pieces of stick thereon, they burn as if burnt by fire.
Sometimes she will hide behind a bush, and, undressing there, fall on
any passer-by in the jungle, assuming the form of a tiger with one of
the four legs in human form. When thus disguised, she is called
Marulupuli (enchanting tiger). If the man is a brave fellow, and
endeavours to kill the Chedipe with any instrument he may have with
him, she will run away; and, if a man belonging to her village detects
her mischief, she will assume her real form, and answer meekly that she
is only digging roots. The above story was obtained by a native revenue
official when he visited a Koyi village, where he was told that a man
had been sentenced to several years&rsquo; imprisonment for being one
of a gang who had murdered a Chedipe for being a sorceress.</p>
<p>In the God&#257;vari district, a sorcerer known as the Ejjugadu
(male physician) is believed, out of spite or for payment, to kill
another by invoking the gods. He goes to a green tree, and there
spreads muggu or chunam (lime) powder, and places an effigy of the
intended victim thereon. He also places a bow and arrow there, and
recites certain spells, and calls on the gods. The victim is said to
die in a couple of days. But, if he understands that the Ejjugadu has
thus invoked the gods, he may inform another Ejjugadu, who will carry
out similar operations under another tree. His bow and arrow will go to
those of the first Ejjugadu, and the two bows and arrows will fight as
long as the spell remains. The man will then be safe. The second
Ejjugadu can give the name of the first, though he has never known
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leading man,&rdquo; the Rev. J. Cain writes, &ldquo;of
the Koyi samatu is called the Samatu Dora, and he is assisted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>by two others, who are called Pettandarulu. The
duties of the Samatu Dora are to preside over all meetings, to settle
all tribal disputes, and to inflict fines for all breaches of caste
rules, of which fines he always receives a certain share. The office is
not necessarily hereditary, and the appointment is generally confirmed
by the landlord of the majority of the villages, be the landlord the
Zemindar or the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Koyis say that their dance is copied from Bh&#299;ma&rsquo;s
march after a certain enemy. The dance is described by Mr. G. F.
Paddison as being &ldquo;a very merry business. They sing for a couple
of beats, and then take two steps round, and sing again. They first
sang to us a song in their own lingo, and then broke into Telugu
&lsquo;<span lang="te-latn">Dora B&#257;bu yemi
istavu</span>&rsquo;&mdash;What will the great man give us? They then
burst into a delightful Autolycus song, &lsquo;Will you give us a
cloth, a jewel for the hair?&lsquo; and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the following account of a dance at the Bh&#363;d&#275;vi
Pandaga festival at Ankagudem in the Polavaram t&#257;luk of the
God&#257;vari district, I am indebted to Mr. N. E. Marjoribanks.
&ldquo;Permission having been given to dance in our presence, the whole
village turned out, and came to our camp. First came about half a dozen
young men, got up in their best clothes, with big metal ear-rings,
basket caps adorned with buffalo horns and pendants of peacock skins
(the neck feathers), and scanty torn cloths, and provided, some with
barrel-shaped tom-toms, others with old rusty flintlocks, and swords.
Next came all the adult women, two by two, each pair clasping hands,
and hanging on to the next pair by holding their waist-cloths with
their free hands. The young men kept up a steady monotonous beat on
their drums, and went through various pantomimes of the chase,
<i>e.g.</i>, shooting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span>and cutting up an animal, or a fight between
two bulls. The women sang a chaunt, and came along slowly, taking one
step back after two steps forwards, copied by the village old men,
women, and children. At the camp, the women went round in this fashion
in circles, the pantomime among the men continuing, and each vying with
the others in suggesting fresh incidents. The women then went through a
series of figures. First the older ones stood in a circle with their
arms intertwined, and the younger girls perched aloft, standing
astraddle on their shoulders. Like this the circle proceeded half
round, and then back again till some of the smaller girls looked as if
they would split in half, their discomfort causing great merriment
among the others. Next all stood in a circle, and jumped round, two
steps one way and then back. This was varied by a backwards and
forwards movement, the chaunt continuing all the time. In&#257;m
(present of money) having been duly disbursed, the double chain of
women went round the camp twice, and made off to the village, all
standing and raising a shout twice as they turned out of the circle to
go. The next day, we were told that the men of the village were all
going hunting in the forest. About the middle of the day, we saw a
procession approaching as on the previous day, but it consisted
entirely of women, the drummers and swordsmen being women dressed up as
men. The chaunt and dance were as before, except that the pantomime
abounded in the most indecent gestures and attitudes, all illustrative
of sexual relations. One girl slipped (or pretended to) and fell.
Whereupon, one of those playing a man&rsquo;s part fell upon her to
ravish her. A rescue ensued amidst roars of merriment, and the would-be
ravisher was in process of being stripped when our modesty compelled us
to call an interval. In the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>evening the men returned
unsuccessful, and, we were told (but did not see it), were pelted with
dung and rubbish. The next day they went out again, and so did we. Our
beats yielded nothing, and we returned to find to our horror the women
of the village awaiting our return. Fortunately we had noticed some
whistling teal on a tank, and had shot some for the pot. I verily
believe this glorious bag was our salvation from dire humiliation. The
same dance and antics were repeated round the bodies of the two tigers
and panther that we shot during our stay. The Koyis insisted on
singeing the whiskers of the beasts, saying we should never get any
more if this was not done. Of course we reduced the ceremony to the
barest form.&rdquo; I gather that, if the Koyis shoot a s&#257;mbar
(deer) or &lsquo;bison,&rsquo; the head is stuck up on the outskirts of
the village, and there are very few villages, which have not got one or
two such trophies. Besides beating for game, the Koyis sit up at night
over salt-licks or water, and thus secure their game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded in the Catalogue Raisonn&eacute; of Oriental
Manuscripts<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1199src" href="#xd21e1199" name=
"xd21e1199src">25</a> that &ldquo;the Coya people reside within their
forest boundaries. If any traveller attempt to pluck fruit from any
tree, his hand is fastened to the spot, so that he cannot move; but if,
on seeing any one of the Coya people, he calls out to that person,
explaining his wishes, and gets permission, then he can take the fruit
and move away, while the Coya forester, on the receipt of a small roll
of tobacco leaf, is abundantly gratified. Besides which, the Coya
people eat snakes. About forty years since, a Br&#257;hman saw a person
cooking snakes for food, and, expressing great astonishment, was told
by the forester that these were mere worms; that, if <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>he
wished to see a serpent, one should be shown him; but that, as for
themselves, secured by the potent charms taught them by
Ambik&#275;svarer, they feared no serpents. As the Br&#257;hman desired
to see this large serpent, a child was sent with a bundle of straw and
a winnowing fan, who went, accompanied by the Br&#257;hman, into the
depths of the forest, and, putting the straw on the mouth of a hole,
commenced winnowing, when smoke of continually varying colours arose,
followed by bright flame, in the midst of which a monstrous serpent
having seven heads was seen. The Br&#257;hman was speechless with
terror at the sight, and, being conducted back by the child, was
dismissed with presents of fruits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mission school at Dummagudem in the God&#257;vari district,
where the Rev. J. Cain has laboured so long and so well, was primarily
intended for Koyis, but I gather that it has been more successful in
dealing with the M&#257;las. In 1905, the lower primary school at
Butchampet in the Kistna district was chiefly attended by Koyi
children.</p>
<p><b>K&#333;yippuram.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Travancore Census
Report, 1901, as a sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Krishnavakakkar.</b>&mdash;The Krishnavakakkars are, in
Travancore, practically confined to the southern taluks of Eraniel and
Kalkulam. The caste name literally means belonging to Krishna, but
probably means nothing more than belonging to the pastoral class, as
the titular suffixes, Ayan and Acchi, to the names of males and
females, found in the early settlement accounts of the State, indicate.
In modern times the title Pillai has been adopted. By some castes,
<i>e.g.</i>, the Sh&#257;nars, they are called Kuruppu.</p>
<p>The tradition is that, in ancient times, a large section of them
migrated from Amb&#257;di, the place of Krishna&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>nativity
and early childhood, to Conjeeveram, in the vicinity of which place
there is still a village called Ayarpati. Here they resided for some
time, and then seventy-two families, seeking fresh fields and pastures
new, proceeded to K&#275;rala, and presented an image of Krishna, which
they had brought from northern India to the reigning king
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja Udaya Martanda Varma. According to another account,
the recipient of the image was one Pallivana Perumal at an earlier
date. The Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, according to the legend, observing the
interesting customs of the immigrants, and especially their devotion to
Krishna, called them Krishnanvaka, and ordered them to serve in the
temple of Krishna (Tiruvampadi within the pagoda of Sri Padman&#257;bha
at Trivandrum). Their leader was given the title of
Ananthapadman&#257;bha Ksh&#275;tra Pallava R&#257;yan. This migration
is supposed to have occurred in the first year of the Malabar era. A
neet, or royal grant, engraved on a copper plate, was issued to them,
by which they were entrusted with the management of the temple, and
commanded to live at Vanchiy&#363;r in Trivandrum. In the pollution
consequent on a birth or death among the seventy-two families, the
image of Krishna, which they had brought, was believed to share for
three days as a distant relation, and, in consequence, the daily
ceremonies at the temple were constantly interrupted. They were told to
remove to a place separated from Trivandrum by at least three rivers,
and settled in the Eraniel and Kalkulam taluks. They were, as a tax in
kind for lands given to them for cultivation, ordered to supply peas
for the Tiruvampati temple. During the reign of Martanda Varma the
Great, from 904 to 933 M.E., successive neets were issued, entrusting
them with diverse duties at this temple. Such, briefly, is the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>tradition as to the early history of the caste in
Travancore. The title Pallava R&#257;yan (chief of the Pallavans) seems
to indicate the country, from which they originally came. They must
have been originally a pastoral class, and they probably proceeded from
Conjeeveram, the capital of the Pallavas, to Travancore, where, being
worshippers of Vishnu, they were entrusted with the discharge of
certain duties at the shrine of Krishna in Trivandrum.</p>
<p>The Krishnavakakkar are not strict vegetarians, as fish constitutes
a favourite diet. Intoxicating liquors are forbidden, and rarely drunk.
In respect to clothing and ornaments, those who follow the
makkath&#257;yam system of inheritance (from father to son) differ from
those who follow the marumakkath&#257;yam system (through the female
line), the former resembling the Vell&#257;las in these matters, and
the latter the N&#257;yars. The only peculiarity about the former is
the wearing of the mukkuthi (nose ornament), characteristic till
recently of all N&#257;yar women in south Travancore, in addition to
the ordinary ornaments of Chettis and other Tamilians. Widows, too,
like the latter, are dressed in white, and the pampadam and melitu in
the ears form their only ornaments. They tie up their hair, not in
front like N&#257;yar women, nor at the back like Tamil women, but in
the middle line above the crown&mdash;the result of a blend between an
indigenous and exotic custom. The hair is passed through a cadjan ring
secured by a ring of beads, and wound round it. The ring is decorated
with arali (<i>Nerium odorum</i>) flowers. Tattooing was very common
among women in former times, but is going out of fashion.</p>
<p>They worship both Siva and Vishnu, and special adoration is paid to
Subramaniya, for whose worship a great shrine is dedicated at Kumara
Koil. Sasta, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>Bhutattan, and Amman have small shrines, called
ilankams, dedicated to them. They live in large groups, each presided
over by a headman called K&#257;ryastan, who is assisted by an
accountant and treasurer. The offices are elective, and not hereditary.
Their priest is known as Karnatan or &#256;s&#257;n. At present there
is apparently only one family of Karnatans, who live at Mepra in the
Eraniel t&#257;luk. The female members of this priestly family are
known as Mangalyama, and do not intermarry or feed with the general
community. The marumakkath&#257;yam Krishnavakakkar speak
Malay&#257;lam, while the makkath&#257;yis speak a very corrupt Tamil
dialect intermixed with Malay&#257;lam.</p>
<p>The names of the seventy-two houses of the caste are remembered,
like the g&#333;tras of the Br&#257;hmans, and marriage between members
of the same house are absolutely forbidden. Among the
marumakkath&#257;yam section, the t&#257;likettu is celebrated in
childhood, and supplemented by the actual wedding after the girl
reaches puberty. On the marriage day, the bridegroom goes in procession
to the house of the bride, sword in hand, and martially clad, probably
in imitation of Krishna on his marriage expedition to the Court of
Kundina. On the third day of the marriage ceremonies, the bride&rsquo;s
party go to the house of the bridegroom with an air of burning
indignation, and every effort is made to appease them. They finally
depart without partaking of the proffered hospitality. On the seventh
day, the newly-married couple return to the bride&rsquo;s house. The
custom is said to be carried out as symbolising the act of
bride-capture resorted to by their ancestor Krishna in securing the
alliance of Rukmani. It is generally believed that fraternal polyandry
once prevailed among these people, and even to-day a widow may be taken
as wife by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>brother of the deceased husband, even though he is
younger than herself. Issue, thus procreated, is the legitimate issue
of the deceased, and acquires full right of inheritance to his
property. If one brother survives the deceased, his widow is not
required to remove her marriage ornament during life.</p>
<p>The origin of the marumakkath&#257;yam custom is alleged to have
been that the first immigrants came with a paucity of women, and had to
contract alliances with the indigenous Travancoreans. At the present
day only about a hundred families follow the law of inheritance through
the female line. Their children are known by the name of the
mother&rsquo;s illam (house). The male, but not the female members of
makkath&#257;yam and marumakkath&#257;yam sections, will eat together.
A daughter, in default of male issue, succeeds to the property of her
father, as opposed to his widow. The Krishnavakakkar believe that, in
these matters, they imitate the P&#257;ndavas. A peculiar feature of
their land-tenure is what is known as utukuru&mdash;a system which
exists to a smaller extent among the Sh&#257;nars of Eraniel and the
adjacent t&#257;luks. In the ayakkettu or old settlement register, it
is not uncommon to find one garden registered in the name of several
persons quite unconnected with each other by any claim of relationship.
In some instances the ground is found registered in the name of one
person, and the trees on it in the name of another.</p>
<p>The dead are generally cremated, and the ashes taken to the foot of
a milky tree, and finally thrown into the sea. On the sixteenth day,
the &#256;s&#257;n is invited to perform the purificatory ceremony. A
quantity of paddy (unhusked rice), raw rice, and cocoanuts, are placed
on a plantain leaf with a cup of gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil, which
is touched by the &#256;s&#257;n, and poured into the hands of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>the celebrants, who, after an oil bath, are free
from pollution.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1245src" href="#xd21e1245"
name="xd21e1245src">26</a></p>
<p><b>Kshatriya.</b>&mdash;The second, or ruling and military caste of
the four castes of Manu. In the Madras Census Report, 1891, it is
recorded that &ldquo;the term Kshatriya is, of course, wholly
inapplicable to the Dravidian races, who might with as much, perhaps
more, accuracy call themselves Turks. There possibly are a few
representatives of the old Kshatriya castes, but the bulk of those who
figure in the returns under this head are pure Dravidian people. The
claim to the title is not confined to the old military classes desirous
of asserting their former position, for we find it put forward by such
castes as Vannias and Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, the one a caste of farmers and
labourers, the other toddy-drawers. It is not possible to distribute
these pseudo-Kshatriyas among their proper castes, as 70,394 of them
have given Kshatriya as the sub-division also.&rdquo; It is noted, in
the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;Parasur&#257;ma is said to
have slain all the Kshatriyas seven times over, but 80,000 persons have
returned themselves as such in this Presidency alone. Strictly
speaking, there are very few persons in the Presidency who have any
real title to the name, and it has been returned mainly by the Pallis
or Vanniyas of Vizagapatam, God&#257;vari, and Chingleput, who say they
are Agnikula Kshatriyas, by the Sh&#257;n&#257;ns of Tinnevelly, and by
some Mahr&#257;tis in South Canara. In Tinnevelly, Kammas and Balijas
have also returned the name.&rdquo; It is further recorded, in the
Mysore Census Report, 1901, that the castes grouped under the head
Kshatriya are &ldquo;the Arasus, R&#257;japuts, Coorgs, and Sikhs. To
the Arasu section belongs the Royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80"
href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>Family of Mysore.&rdquo; Some
R&#257;chevars style themselves Arya Kshatriyalu.</p>
<p>For the following note on Malay&#257;la &lsquo;Kshatriyas,&rsquo; I
am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. There is an old Sanskrit verse,
which describes eight classes of Kshatriyas as occupying K&#275;rala
from very early times, namely, Bhupala or Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, as those
of Travancore and Cochin, R&#257;jaka or R&#257;ja, as those of
Mavelikkara and Cranganore, Kosi or Koil Tampur&#257;n, Purav&#257;n or
Tampan, Sri Purogama or Tirumulpp&#257;d, Bhandari or Pandarattil,
Audvahika or Tirumulpp&#257;d, and Cheta or S&#257;manta. The
S&#257;mantas cannot be looked upon as Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas proper.
The indigenous Kshatriyas of K&#275;rala are divided into four well
distinguishable septs, viz., the Koil Pandala, the R&#257;ja, the
Tampan; and the Tirumulpp&#257;d. The total number of Malay&#257;la
Kshatriyas in Travancore is 1,575, the largest number living in the
t&#257;luks of Tiruvella, Vaikam, and Mavelikara. Tampans live mostly
at Vaikam, and Tirumulpp&#257;ds at Shertallay and Tiruvella. The
remaining two septs are not so much caste septs as isolated groups of
families. Koil Pandala literally means the keeper of the royal
treasury. Tampan is a corruption of Tampur&#257;n, the latter being a
title directly applied to the R&#257;jas, while the term
Tirumulpp&#257;d, in its literal sense, conveys the idea of those who
wait before kings. Women are known as Tumpurattis in the first two, as
Tampattis in the third, and Nampishthatiris in the fourth division. The
Pantalam R&#257;jas have the title of Sriviradhara, and those of
Mullanikkadu of Narasimha.</p>
<p>According to immemorial tradition, Koil Tampur&#257;ns were the
nephews of the Ch&#275;raman Perum&#257;ls or viceroys of Ch&#275;ra,
who ruled at Cranganore, their earliest residence being Beypore in
British Malabar, where three or four <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>families of this sept
lived at the beginning of the Christian era. From one of these
families, male members were invited about 300 M.E., for marrying the
ladies of the Venadswarupam, <i>i.e.</i>, the Travancore royal house.
They began to live at Kilimanur in the Chirayinkil t&#257;luk, six
miles from Attingal, where the female members of the royal family
permanently resided. In 963 M.E., the year in which T&#299;p&#363;
Sult&#257;n invaded Malabar, eight persons, five females and three
males, belonging to the Alyankodu Kovilakam in North Malabar fled, and
found shelter in Travancore. All their expenses were commanded to be
met from the State treasury. As the five women were only cousins and
not uterine sisters, one of them removed herself to the rural village
Kirtipuram near Kandiyur in the Mavelikkara t&#257;luk, and thence to
Gr&#257;mam, a little further in the interior. Another, in course of
time, settled at Pallam in Kottayam, and a third at Paliyakkara in
Tiruvella, while the fourth, having no issue, stayed with the youngest
at the Nirazhi palace of Changanacheri. This last lady gave birth to
five children, being three females and two males. The first of these
branches removed to Anantapuram in Kartikapalli in 1040, and the second
to Chemprol in Tiruvella in 1041, while the third continued to reside
at Changanacheri. After 1040 M.E., three more Koil Pandala families
immigrated from British Malabar, and settled at Cherukol, Karamma, and
Vatakkematham. These, however, are not so important as the previous
ones. As already stated, the Kilimanur Koil Tampur&#257;ns were among
these the earliest settlers in Travancore, and a whole property
(revenue village) was granted to them in freehold in 1728 A.D., in
recognition of the sacrifice a member of the family made in saving the
life of a Travancore prince from the murderous attack of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>Ettuveetil Pillamar. The first family of
Kolasvarupam R&#257;jas immigrated into Travancore in the fifth century
M.E. As the Travancore royal house then stood in need of adoption,
arrangements were made through a Koil Tampur&#257;n of the Tattari
Kovilakam to bring two princesses for adoption from Kolattunad, and the
first family of R&#257;jas, known as the Putupalli Kovilakam, settled
at Kartikapalli. The family is now extinct, as the last member died in
1033 M.E. The next family that migrated was Cheriyakovilakam between
920 and 930, also invited for purposes of adoption. These latter lived
at Aranmula. The third series of migrations were during the invasion of
Malabar by T&#299;p&#363; Sult&#257;n in 964 M.E., when all the
R&#257;jas living at the time went over to Travancore, though, after
the disturbance was over, many returned home. The R&#257;jas of the
Kolasvarupam began to settle permanently in the country, as they could
claim relationship with the reigning sovereigns, and were treated by
them with brotherly affection. There were only two branches at the
beginning, namely, Pallikovilakam and Udayamangalam. The families of
Mavelikara, Ennaykkad and Prayikkara are divisions of the
Chengakkovilakam house. The Udayamangalam house has branched off into
three divisions, Mittil, whose descendants now live at Mariyapalli,
Nedumprum, and Kartikapalli. Naduvilekkovilakam members live at
Perinjel in Aranmula, and Cheriyakovilakam, whose members are divided
into five other families, in the same locality. No branch of the
Udayamangalam house resides in British Malabar. Some of these branches
even now own large estates in that collectorate. There are two other
important families of R&#257;jas in Travancore, viz., those of Pantalam
and Punjat. Both of them are believed to have been related to the early
P&#257;ndyan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>kings. The reason alleged for the immigration of
the Pantalam R&#257;jas into Travancore is the persecution of a Nayak
minister in medi&aelig;val times, who compelled them to change their
mode of inheritance from marumakkath&#257;yam (in the female line) to
makkath&#257;yam (from father to son), and then marry his daughter.
They are supposed to have sojourned at Sivagiri and Tenk&#257;si in the
Tinnevelly district on their way to Travancore. Ilattur in the
Shenkottah t&#257;luk originally belonged to them, but was afterwards
taken over by Travancore in default of payment of the annual subsidy.
Tampans are believed by tradition to have had territorial sovereignty
in K&#275;rala, until they were deprived of it by the Ilayetasvarupam
kings. This does not appear to have any basis of truth, as the
Ilayetasvarupam kings lived in Central Travancore, while the Tampans
live in the north, where the former are never known to have led any
invasion. In medi&aelig;val times, both Tampans and Tirumalpp&#257;ds
were invariably commanders of armies. With the invasion of Malabar by
T&#299;p&#363; Sult&#257;n, many sought refuge in the kingdom of
Travancore, and continued to live here after the passing of the
storm.</p>
<p>The Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas are as a class learned. Both men and
women are, in the main, accomplished Sanskrit scholars. Mr. Kerla
Varma, <span class="sc">C.S.I.</span>, Valiyakoil Tampur&#257;n, a
finished poet and an accomplished patron of letters, and Mr. Ravi
Varma, the talented artist, are both Koil Tampur&#257;ns. The houses of
the Koil Tampur&#257;ns and R&#257;jas are known as kottarams or
kovilakams, <i>i.e.</i>, palaces, while those of the Tampans and
Tirumalpp&#257;ds are known as kovilakams and mathams. The
Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas resemble the Br&#257;hmans in their food and
drink. The males dress like the Namb&#363;tiris, while the dress and
ornaments of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>women are like those of other classes in Malabar
There are, however, three special ornaments which the Kshatriya ladies
particularly wear, viz., cheru-t&#257;li, entram, and kuzhal. The Koil
Pandalas and R&#257;jas are landlords of considerable wealth, and a few
have entered the Civil Service of the State. The Tampans and
Tirumalpp&#257;ds, besides being landlords and agriculturists, are
personal servants of the ruling families of K&#275;rala, the latter
holding this position to even a greater extent than the former. The
Kshatriya personal attendants of the Mahar&#257;jas of Travancore serve
them with characteristic fidelity and devotion.</p>
<p>The Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas are a particularly religious community.
In a place within their houses, called t&#275;varappura or the room for
religious worship, the Vaishnavite s&#257;lagr&#257;ma and Saivite
linga are kept together with the images of other deities, and
Br&#257;hmans officiate at their worship. Ganapati p&#363;ja (worship),
and antinamaskaram are regularly observed.</p>
<p>As all the Koil Tampur&#257;ns belong to one sept or g&#333;tra,
that of Visvamitra, and all the R&#257;jas to another, that of
Bhargava, neither of these divisions are permitted to marry among
themselves. The Tirumalpp&#257;ds also, with their local divisions such
as Ancherri, Koyikkal, Plamtanam, and Kannezham, own Visvamitra, and
hence do not marry among themselves. As for the Tampans, all the
families belonging to that group trace their descent to a common
ancestor, and belong to the same sept as the Koil Tampur&#257;ns and
Tirumalpp&#257;ds. As a consequence, while the Koil Tampurattis are
married to Namb&#363;tiri husbands, the Koil Tampur&#257;ns themselves
take wives from the families of R&#257;jas. R&#257;jas may keep
N&#257;yar or S&#257;manta ladies as mistresses, the same being the
case with the Tampans and Tirumalpp&#257;ds also. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>R&#257;nis of Pantalam take Namb&#363;tiri
husbands, while Tampan and Tirumalpp&#257;d women live with any class
of Br&#257;hmans. No Kshatriya lady is permitted to leave her home for
that of her husband, and so no grihaprevesa ceremony prevails among
them. Thirteen is the proper age for marrying girls, but the marriage
may be postponed until the choice of a fit husband is made. In the
branches of the Kolattunad family, girls who attain puberty as maids
are obliged to keep a vow, in honour of Ganapati.</p>
<p>The Tampan and Tirumalpp&#257;d women, as also those of the Pantalam
family, have their t&#257;lis (marriage badge) tied by Aryappattars.
Remarriage of widows is permitted. Polygamy is rare. Divorce may take
place at the will of either party, and prevails largely in practice.
The R&#257;jas make a donation of Rs. 50 to 70 as stridhanam, excepting
those of Pantalam, who only pay about Rs. 35.</p>
<p>Some time before the auspicious hour for the marriage of a Koil
Tampuratti, the Br&#257;hmanipattu, or recitation of certain
Pur&#257;nic songs by a female of the Br&#257;hmani caste, begins. Four
lighted lamps are placed in the middle of the hall, with a fifth
dedicated to Ganapati in the centre. While these songs are being sung,
the bride appears in the tattu dress with a brass minu and a bunch of
flowers in her hand, and sits on a wooden seat kept ready for the
purpose. The songs generally relate to the conception of Devaki, and
the birth of Krishna. Then a N&#257;yar of the Illam sept waves a pot
containing cocoanut, flowers, burning wicks, etc., before the bride,
after which she rises to wash her feet. At this point the bridegroom
arrives, riding on an elephant, with a sword in his hand, and the
procession is conducted with much ceremony and ostentation. He then
bathes, and two pieces of cloth, to be worn by him thereafter, are
touched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>by the bride. Wearing them, the bridegroom
approaches the bride, and presents her with a suit of clothes known as
the mantrakoti. One of the clothes is worn as a tattu, and with the
other the whole body is covered. The mother of the bride gives her a
brass mirror and a garland, both of which she takes in her hand to the
altar where the marriage is to be performed. After the punyaha,
accompanied by a few preliminary h&#333;mas or sacrifices to the fire,
by the Namb&#363;tiri family priest, the first item in the ceremony,
known as mukhadarsana or seeing each other, begins. The bride then
removes the cloth covering her body. The next events are udakapurva,
panigrahana, and mangalyadharana, which are respectively the
presentation by the bride of water to the bridegroom, his taking her
hand in token of the union, and tying the t&#257;li round the neck of
the bride. The next item is the saptapadi (seven feet), and the last
dikshaviruppu, peculiar to the Malay&#257;lam Kshatriyas. A particular
room is gaily decorated, and a long piece of white cotton cloth is
spread on the floor. Upon this a black carpet is spread, and a lighted
lamp, which should never be extinguished, placed in the vicinity. The
bride has to remain in this room throughout the marriage. On the
marriage night commences the aupasana, or joint sacrifice to the fire.
On the fourth day are the mangalasnana or auspicious bath, and
procession through the town. On that night consummation takes place.
The procession of the bridegroom (m&#257;ppilapurappat) to the house of
the bride is a noticeable item. The brother of the bride receives him
at the gate, and, after washing his feet, informs him that he may bathe
and marry the girl. The uduku-purva rite is performed by the brother
himself. When the bridegroom leaves the marriage hall with the bride,
an armed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>Pandala stops them, and a fixed present is given
to him. Every rite is performed according to the method prescribed by
Bodhayana among the Koil Tampur&#257;ns and R&#257;jas, the family at
Pantalam alone following the directions of Asvalayana. On the fourth
day, the contracting couple bathe, and wear clothes previously dipped
in turmeric water. At night, while the Br&#257;hmani song is going on,
they sit on a plank, where jasmine flowers are put on, and the goddess
Bhagavathi is worshipped. The bride&rsquo;s maternal uncle ties a sword
round her loins, which is immediately untied by the bridegroom in token
of the fact that he is her future supporter. Panchamehani is a peculiar
rite on the fifth day, when an atti (<i>Ficus</i>, sp.) tree is
decorated, and an offering of food made on the grass before it. The
couple also make a pretence of catching fish. In modern times, the
Pantalam R&#257;jas do not patronise the songs of the Br&#257;hmani,
and, among them, the panchamehani is conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>Women are in theory the real owners of property, though in practice
the eldest male has the management of the whole. There is no division
of property, but, in some cases, certain estates are specially allotted
for the maintenance of specific members. The authorities of the
Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas in all matters of social dispute are the
Namb&#363;tiri Vaidikas.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she is kept in a room twelve feet apart
from the rest for a period of three days. On the fourth day, after a
bath, she puts on a new cloth, and walks, with a brass mirror in her
hand, to her house. Among the Kolattunad R&#257;jas there are a few
additional rites, including the Br&#257;hmani&rsquo;s song. The
pumsavana and simanta are performed by the family priest. On the birth
of a child, the jatakarma is performed, when women <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>mix
honey and clarified butter with gold, to be given to the child. On the
twelfth day, the Namb&#363;tiri priest performs the namakarna, after a
purifying ceremony which terminates the birth pollution. The eldest
child is generally named R&#257;ja R&#257;ja Varma. Udaya Varma and
Martanda Varma are names found among the R&#257;jas, but absent among
the Koil Tampur&#257;ns. Martanda Varma was once exclusively used only
among the members of the Travancore Royal Family. The full style and
titles of the present Mahar&#257;ja of Travancore are His Highness the
Mahar&#257;ja Sir Sri Padmanabha Dasa Vanchi Bala R&#257;ma Varma,
Kulasekhara Kiritapati Sultan Manne Mahar&#257;ja R&#257;ja
R&#257;mar&#257;ja Bahadur Samsher Jung, <span class="sc">G.C.S.I.,
G.C.I.E.</span> Raghava Varma is a name peculiar to the Pantalam
R&#257;jas. Women are, as in the case of Tirumalpp&#257;ds and Tampans,
called Amba, Ambika, Ambalika, Mangala, etc.</p>
<p>The annaprasana and nishkramana are performed consecutively on the
same day. The mother takes the child to the foot of a jak
(<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>) tree, and, going thrice round it,
touches it with the leg of the child, and then dips a golden ring in
the payasa, and applies it to the child&rsquo;s lips. The same act is
then repeated by the maternal uncle, father, and next of kin. The
Yatrakali is attended with much &eacute;clat during the night. The
upanayana, or investiture with the sacred thread, takes place as late
as the sixteenth year. As a preliminary rite on the same day, the
chaula or tonsure ceremony is performed. It is formally done by the
Namb&#363;tiri priest in the capacity of guru or preceptor, and left to
be completed by the M&#257;r&#257;n. The priest then invests the boy
with the thread, and, with the sacrificial fire as lord and witness,
initiates him into the G&#257;yatri prayer. All Kshatriyas are obliged
to repeat this prayer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span>ten times morning and evening. On the fourth
day, the youth listens to a few Vaidic hymns recited by the priest.
There is not the prolonged course of discipline of a Br&#257;hmanical
Br&#257;hmachari, such as the Namb&#363;tiris so religiously observe.
The samavartana, or completion of the pupilage ceremony, takes place on
the fourth day. The ceremony of proceeding to Benares, the pre-eminent
seat of learning in ancient days, which is the natural after-event of
the Vaidic pupilage, is then gone through, as in the case of
Br&#257;hmans. A would-be father-in-law intercedes, and requests the
snataka to bless his daughter, and settle in life as a grihastha. The
Namb&#363;tiri priest then reminds the boy of his duty as a Kshatriya,
and gives him a sword as a symbol of his pre-ordained function in
society. He then becomes a grihastha, and may chew betel leaf. The
Saivite panchakshara, and the Vaishnavite ashtakshara are also taught,
and are invariably recited after the performance of the daily duties.
For girls only the chaula is performed, and that along with her
marriage. On the occasion of birthdays, the family priest performs the
ayushya h&#333;ma, and shashtipurti, or celebration of the sixtieth
birthday, is also observed as an important religious occasion.</p>
<p>The funeral ceremonies are almost the same as those of
Namb&#363;tiris. When a Koil Tampur&#257;n dies, he is placed on the
bare floor, some hymns being recited in his ears. The corpse is placed
on a stretcher made of plantain stems, and the head is touched with a
razor in token of shaving. It is bathed, covered with a new cloth, and
decorated with flowers and sandal paste. K&#363;sa grass is received at
the hands of a M&#257;r&#257;n. The funeral rites are performed by the
nephews. Pollution is observed for eleven days and nights. A religious
vow is observed for a year. The offering to the spirit of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>deceased is not in the form of cooked food, but of
presents to Br&#257;hmans. All the Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas are
adherents of the Yajur-v&#275;da. The anniversary of maternal
grandmothers, and even sisters is punctiliously observed. If a maternal
aunt or grandaunt dies without children, their sr&#257;ddhas must be
performed as for the rest.</p>
<p>The Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas hold rank next to the Br&#257;hmans,
and above the Ilayatus. They are permitted to take their meal in the
same row with the Br&#257;hmans, and receive prasada from the temples
directly from the priest, and standing at the right side of the inner
gate.</p>
<p>Further information concerning the Malay&#257;la Kshatriyas is
contained in an article by Mr. K. Rama Varma R&#257;ja,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1320src" href="#xd21e1320" name=
"xd21e1320src">27</a> who concludes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Kshatriya community is an intermediate caste between the Br&#257;hmin
(Namburi) and the Sudra (Nair) classes, and has affinities to both; to
the former in matters of ablution, ceremonies, food and drink, and to
the latter in those of real matrimonial relations and inheritance,
<i>i.e.</i>, the constitution and propagation of the family.... The
intermediate caste must be the Aryans more Dravidianised, or the
Dravidians more Aryanised, that is, the Aryans degraded or the
Dravidians elevated, more probably the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1328src" href=
"#xd21e1328" name="xd21e1328src">28</a> in a note on the ancestry of
the R&#257;jas of Jeypore, that &ldquo;the family chronicles ascribe a
very ancient origin to the line of the Jeypore Zamindars. Beginning
with Kanakas&#275;na of the solar race, a general and feudatory of the
king of Kashmir, they trace the pedigree through thirty-two generations
down to Vin&#257;yaka Deo, a younger son, who left Kashmir rather than
hold a subordinate position, went to Benares, did penance <span class=

K&#257;si Visv&#275;svarasv&#257;mi there, and was told by the god in a
dream to go to the kingdom of Nandapuram belonging to the Silavamsam
line, of which he would become king. Vin&#257;yaka Deo, continues the
legend, proceeded thither, married the king&rsquo;s daughter, succeeded
in 1443 A.D. to the famous throne of thirty-two steps there, and
founded the family of Jeypore. Vin&#257;yaka Deo and his six
successors, say the family papers, had each only one son, and the sixth
of them, V&#299;ra Vikrama (1637&ndash;69) accordingly resolved to
remove his residence elsewhere. The astrologers and wise men reported
that the present Jeypore was &lsquo;a place of the Kshatriya
class,&rsquo; and it was accordingly made the capital, and named after
the famous Jeypore of the north.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>K&#363;dan.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the K&#363;dans,
or &ldquo;Kootans&rdquo; of the west coast, I am indebted to Mr. L. K.
Anantha Krishna Aiyar<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1351src" href=
"#xd21e1351" name="xd21e1351src">29</a>:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Kootans are agricultural labourers, and take part in every kind
of work connected with agriculture, such as turning the soil,
ploughing, sowing, manuring, weeding, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>transplanting, and the
like. As soon as the monsoon is over, they work in gardens, turning the
soil, watering, and fencing. They form one of the divisions of the
slave castes, working under some landlord or farmer for a daily wage of
an edangazhy of paddy (unhusked rice) during the rainy months of June,
July, and August and of two edangazhis during the other months of the
year. They receive, for the &#332;nam and Vishu festivals, a para of
paddy, some salt, cocoanuts, oil, and chillies. On the day of the
village festival, every male gets a mundu (cloth) or two, and every
female a kacha (cloth) or two, in addition to toddy and arrack
(spirituous liquor), and the other articles mentioned above. They dress
themselves in their cloths, and are treated to a sumptuous dinner. With
shouts of joy, they attend, and take part in the village festival. When
they fall ill, they are properly looked after by their masters, both on
account of their good feelings towards them, and also of the loss of
work they may have to sustain, should they be laid up for a long time.
Whenever a landlord or farmer has more men than he can afford to give
work and wages to, he generally lends their services to some one else
on a pattom of four paras of paddy a year for a male, and three for a
female. The new master gives them work and wages, and sends them back
when they are no longer wanted. Should a Kootan run away from his
master, he is brought back either by threat or mild word; but, should
these fail, there is no remedy to force him back. In spite of the
abolition of slavery some sixty years ago, the Kootans are in a state
of bondage. They live in small huts with insufficient food, plodding on
from day to day with no hope of improving their condition. Their huts
are erected on four bamboo posts. The roofs are thatched, and the sides
protected by mud walls, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>or covered with palm leaves. A bamboo
framework, with similar leaves, serves the purpose of a door. There is
a verandah in front. The Kootans have a few earthen and bamboo utensils
for domestic use. They take rice kanji (gruel) prepared the previous
night, with salt and chillies. They have some leisure at midday, during
which they go to their huts, and take kanji with a fish or two boiled
in it, or sometimes with some vegetable curry. At night, boiled rice,
or kanji with fish or curry made of vegetables from their kitchen
garden, form their chief food. All their provisions are acquired by
exchange of paddy from a petty shop-keeper in their vicinity.</p>
<p>They eat and drink at the hands of all castes except Paraiyans,
Pulayans, Ull&#257;dans, and N&#257;y&#257;dis. In some parts of the
State, they approach the houses of Izhuvas, and no other castes eat
with them. They have to keep at a distance of forty-eight feet from all
high-caste Hindus. They are polluted by Pulayas, N&#257;y&#257;dis, and
Ull&#257;dans, who have to stand at some distance from them. They may
take water from the wells of M&#257;ppillas. They are their own barbers
and washermen, and may approach the temple of their village goddess
K&#257;li on some special days, while, at other times, they have to
stand far away.</p>
<p>When a girl attains puberty, she is lodged in a corner of the hut.
The inmates thereof may neither touch nor approach her on the score of
pollution. Four or seven girls, who are invited, bathe the girl on the
first day. The pollution lasts for seven days, and, on the morning of
the seventh day, seven girls take her to a tank (pond) or river to
bathe. A kai-bali is waved round her face, and, as she bathes, it is
floated on the water. On their return to the hut, the girls are fed,
and allowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>to depart with a present of an anna each. Their
relatives, and others who are invited, are well entertained. A kai-bali
is an offering held in the hand of a woman, and may take the form of a
sacrificed fowl, plantain fruits, boiled rice, etc.</p>
<p>Girls are generally married after puberty. A Kootan can enter into a
sambandham (alliance) with a woman of his own caste, or with a Pulaya
woman. He has to bathe before he returns to his hut, if he should stay
for the night with a woman of the latter caste. This proves that he
belongs to a caste superior to that of the Pulayas, and the union
resembles that of a Br&#257;hman with a S&#363;dra woman. Should a
woman of the Kootan caste mate with a Pulaya, she is at once turned out
of caste. A Kootan, who wishes to enter into a sambandham with a woman
of his own or the Pulaya caste, goes to her hut with one or two of his
relations or friends, to recommend him to the parents of the woman to
permit him to enter into conjugal relations with their daughter, or
form kutikuduka. With their permission, they become a kind of husband
and wife. In most cases, the will of the man and the woman is
sufficient for the union. The woman generally stays with her parents,
and very often her lover comes to her with his wages after the
day&rsquo;s hard work, and stays with her for the night. Should she
wish to accompany him to his hut, she does so with her wages in the
evening. They exercise sexual license even before marriage. If a woman
who has no open lover becomes pregnant, her fault is condoned when she
mentions her lover&rsquo;s name. When one dislikes the other for some
reason or other, they separate, and are at liberty to form new unions.
Widows may remarry, and may even associate with their brothers-in-law.
The Kootans follow the marumakkath&#257;yam law of inheritance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>(in the female line). They have no property,
except sometimes a sheep or a few fowls.</p>
<p>The Kootans believe in magic and sorcery. Mann&#257;ns and
Muhammadan M&#257;ppillas are sometimes consulted, and these dupe them.
They profess the lower forms of Hinduism, and worship the local village
deity (K&#257;li), and the spirits of their ancestors, whom they
represent by means of stones placed on a raised floor under a tree, and
to whom boiled rice, parched grain, toddy, plantain fruits, and
cocoanuts are offered at the Vishu and &#332;nam festivals, and on
Karkatakam, Thulam, and Makara Sankranti. Care is always taken to have
the offerings served separately on leaves, lest the ancestors should
quarrel with one another, and do them harm. Should illness, such as
cholera, small-pox, or fever occur in a family, some fowls and an anna
or two are offered at the temple to the goddess Bhagavathi, who is
believed to be able to save them from the impending calamity.</p>
<p>When a member of the caste breathes his last, the landlord gives a
spade to dig the grave, an axe or knife for cutting wood to serve as
fuel if the corpse is to be burned, a piece of cloth for covering the
dead body, and also some paddy and millet to meet the funeral expenses.
A cocoanut is broken, and placed on the neck of the corpse, which is
covered with the cloth, and carried on a bier to the burial-ground,
which is sprinkled over with water mixed with turmeric. When the
funeral is over, the people who attended it, including the relatives
and friends of the deceased, bathe, and go to the hut of the dead
person, where they are served with kanji and toddy, after which they
depart. The members of the family, and close relatives of the deceased,
fast for the night. In the case of a man dying, his nephew is the chief
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>mourner, while, in that of a woman, her eldest son
and daughter are the chief mourners, who do not go to work for two
weeks. The chief mourners bathe in the early morning, cook a small
quantity of rice, and offer it to the spirit of the deceased. It is
eaten up by the crows. This is continued for fourteen days, and, on the
fourteenth night, all fast. On the fifteenth morning, they regard
themselves as having been cleansed from the pollution. All the castemen
of the kara (settlement) are invited, and bring with them rice,
curry-stuffs, and toddy. Their Enangan cleans and sweeps the hut, while
the rest go to the grave-yard, turn the earth, and make it level. They
bathe, and the Enangans sprinkle cow-dung water on the grave. They
return home, and partake of a sumptuous meal, after which they all take
leave of the chief mourner, who observes the diksha, bathes in the
early morning, and offers the bali (ball of rice) before he goes to
work. This he continues for a whole year, after which he gets shaved,
and celebrates a feast in honour of the dead.</p>

Vakkaliga and Kurni. Gurram, also meaning horse, has been recorded as
an exogamous sept of Chenchu, Golla, M&#257;la, Padma S&#257;l&#275;,
and Togata. Gurram Togatas will not ride on horseback.</p>
<p><b>Kudiya.</b>&mdash;The Kudiyas or Mal&#275; (hill) Kudiyas are
found at Neriya, Darmasthala, and Sisila in the South <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>Canara
district. Those who live at the two former places are agrestic slaves
of landlords who own cardamom plantations on the gh&#257;ts. They live
for the most part in the jungles, beneath rocks, in caves, or in low
huts, and shift from one spot to another. At the season of the cardamom
crop, they come down to the plains once a week with the produce. They
are said to carry off cardamoms to the Mysore frontier, and sell them
fraudulently to contractors or merchants. They make fire traces for the
Forest Department.</p>
<p>Except in stature, the Kudiyas have not retained the characters of a
primitive race, and, as the result of racial admixture, or contact
metamorphosis, some individuals are to be seen with comparatively light
coloured skins, and mesorhine or leptorhine noses. In the matter of
personal names, septs, and ceremonial observances, they have been much
influenced by other castes. They speak a corrupt form of Tulu, and say
that they follow the aliya sant&#257;na law of inheritance (in the
female line), though some, especially at Sisala and on the Mysore
frontier, follow the law of succession from father to son (makkala
sant&#257;na). They are not regarded as a polluting class, and can
enter all parts of their landlords&rsquo; houses, except the kitchen
and dining-room. They are presided over by a headman, called
Gurik&#257;ra, who inquires into transgression of caste rules, and
assists on ceremonial occasions. Their chief deities are Bhairava,
K&#257;mand&#275;varu, and the Pancha P&#257;ndavas (the five
P&#257;ndava brothers), but they also believe in certain bh&#363;thas
(devils), such as Mal&#275; Kallurti and Ambatadaiva.</p>
<p>The Kudiyas do not object to marriage between a widowed woman and
her eldest son. Among those attached to a landlord at Neriya, two such
cases were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>pointed out. In one, there was no issue, but in
the other a son had been born to the mother-wife.</p>
<p>When the arrangement of a match is in contemplation, the father of
the prospective bridegroom goes, accompanied by two women, to the
girl&rsquo;s home, and takes with him betel leaves, areca-nuts, and
gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil. If the girl&rsquo;s parents consent to
the match, they accept the oil; otherwise they refuse it. The binding
part of the marriage ceremony consists of the bridal couple standing
with their hands united, and the pouring of water thereon by the
bride&rsquo;s father. The Kudiyas who have settled on the plains have
adopted the ceremonial observances of the Bants and other castes. The
remarriage of widows is permitted. There is no elaborate marriage
ceremony, but sometimes the contracting couple stand in the presence of
the headman and a few others, and make a round mark with sandal paste
on each other&rsquo;s foreheads.</p>
<p>If a member of the tribe dies near the settlement, the body is
cremated, and, if far away therefrom, buried. On the third day, a visit
is paid to the place where cremation took place, and the son or some
near relative of the deceased goes round the spot on which the corpse
was burnt three times, and sprinkles rice thereon thrice. Five leaves
of the teak or plantain, or other big leaves, are spread on the ground,
and fowl&rsquo;s flesh, cooked rice, and vegetables are placed thereon,
and the ancestors are invoked in the words &ldquo;Oh! old souls, gather
up the new soul, and support it, making it one of you.&rdquo; On the
sixteenth day, food is again offered on leaves. In cases where burial
is resorted to, an effigy of the deceased is made in straw, and burnt.
On the third day, the ashes are taken to the grave, and buried.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a note on the Kudiyas of the plains, it is recorded<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1416src" href="#xd21e1416" name=
"xd21e1416src">30</a> that &ldquo;the dead are either burned or buried,
the former being the custom in the case of rich men. On the seventh day
after cremation or burial, a pandal (booth) is erected over the grave
or the place of cremation, and a bleached cloth is spread on it by the
washerman. A wick floating in half a cocoanut shell full of oil is then
lighted, and placed at each corner of the pandal. The relations of the
deceased then gather round the place, and weep, and throw a handful of
rice over the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kudiyas are fond of toddy, and eat black monkeys, and the big
red squirrel, which they catch with snares.</p>

<p><b>Kudluk&#257;ra.</b>&mdash;Kudluk&#257;ra or
Kud&#257;ld&#275;shk&#257;ra is a sub-division of
R&#257;jap&#363;ri.</p>
<p><b>Kudubi.</b>&mdash;The Kudubis are found mainly in the
Kundap&#363;r t&#257;luk of the South Canara district. Among
themselves, they use Kaluv&#257;di as the caste name. They say that
they are divided into the following sections: &#256;r&#275;, Goa,
J&#333;gi, Kodiy&#257;l, and Kariya. Of these, the &#256;r&#275;, Goa,
and Kodiy&#257;l Kudubis are confined to the Kundap&#363;r t&#257;luk,
and the other two sections are found in villages near Mudbidri. Both
the &#256;r&#275; and J&#333;gi sections speak Mar&#257;thi, and the
latter are considered inferior to the former, who will not eat in their
houses. &#256;r&#275; women clad themselves in black or red garments,
whereas J&#333;gi women are said to wear white cloths. The Goa and
Kariya Kudubis speak Konkani, and do not mix with the &#256;r&#275;s
and J&#333;gis, even for meals. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>They are much influenced by
Br&#257;hmanical priests, by whom they are guided in their ceremonial
observances, and have adopted the dh&#257;re form of marriage
(<i>see</i> Bant). The Goa Kudubis say that they emigrated to South
Canara owing to the oppression from which they suffered, bringing with
them the sweet potato (<i>Ipom&oelig;a Batatas</i>), cashew nut
(<i>Anacardium occidentale</i>), chrysanthemum, and Indian spinach
(<i>Basella alba</i>). Among the Goa Kudubis, an adulterer has to
undergo a curious form of punishment. His head is clean-shaved, and his
moustache removed. He then stands in a pit, and leaf-platters, off
which food has been eaten, are thrown on his head. A money fine is
imposed by the headman. If a woman does not confess her guilt, she is
made to stand in the sun with an iron rod on her shoulders.</p>
<p>The &#256;r&#275; Kudubis have exogamous septs, or wargs. Each warg
is said to have its own god, which is kept in the house of some elderly
or respected member of the sept. A corner of the house, or a special
room, is set apart for the god, and a member of the family is the
p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest). He is expected to do p&#363;ja to the god
every Monday. Ordinarily, rice, fruits, etc., are offered to it; but,
during the big festival in November-December, fowls are sacrificed.
Like other Mar&#257;thi castes, the &#256;r&#275; Kudubis regard the
Holi festival. On the first day, they collect together, and worship the
tulsi katt&#275;&mdash;a square structure on which a tulsi (<i>Ocimum
sanctum</i>) plant is growing. On the following days, they go about in
detached groups, some males being dressed up as females, with drums and
cymbals, and dance and sing. On the last day of the festival, rice is
cooked, offered with liquor to Kalabhairava, and eaten. The
&#256;r&#275; Kudubis sometimes worship bh&#363;thas (devils),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span><i>e.g.</i>, Jettiga, and Hola Hayaguli. Special
reverence is shown to the tulsi plant, and, at almost every house, it
is planted in a brindhavan or katt&#275;. To it vegetables and fruits
are offered.</p>
<p>Girls are married either before or after puberty. Widows are allowed
to remarry, but may not marry a man of the sept to which her deceased
husband belonged. Marriage ceremonies last over five days, and commence
with the ide karuchi, or betrothal, at the house of the bride-elect.
P&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel leaves and areca-nuts) is distributed to at
least one member of each warg present according to a recognised code of
precedence, commencing with the Hivel&#275;kar warg, which is
considered superior. On the second day, a post made of the wood of the
silk-cotton tree (<i>Bombax malabaricum</i>) is set up beneath the
marriage pandal (booth). The bridegroom and his party go in procession
to the bride&rsquo;s house, where the contracting couple are decorated
with jewels, and turmeric-dyed strings are tied round their necks. The
bride&rsquo;s father ties a kankanam (thread) on his own wrist. The
couple stand facing each other, with a screen stretched between them.
After the exchange of garlands, their hands are joined, and the screen
is removed. They then go five times round the <i>Bombax</i> post and
marriage dais, and sit down. Dh&#257;re water is poured over their
united hands by the bride&rsquo;s father. Rice is then thrown over
them, and presents are given. The proceedings terminate with the waving
of coloured water, a light, etc. The dh&#257;re ceremony is celebrated
at night. On the third day, the bridal couple go five times round the
<i>Bombax</i> post set up at the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and take
their seats on the dais. Rice is thrown, and betel leaves and
areca-nuts are distributed. On the fourth <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>and fifth days, the
same items are gone through at the bride&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In the case of the remarriage of a widow, the bride and bridegroom
take their seats, and rice is thrown over them. The dh&#257;re water is
not poured over their hands. Sometimes, the marriage consists merely in
the holding of a feast.</p>
<p>The dead are buried in a sitting posture, with the legs crossed
tailor-wise. Before the grave is filled in, a small quantity of cooked
rice is put in the mouth of the corpse. On the third day, a small mound
is made over the grave, and food offered to it. The final death
ceremonies take place on the eleventh day, and consist in the
sprinkling of holy water, and giving presents to Br&#257;hmans. By the
prosperous members of the community, a caste feast is given on the
twelfth day.</p>
<p>The main occupation of the Kudubis is shifting (kum&#257;ri)
cultivation. Some, however, are employed in the preparation of cutch
(catechu) from the wood of <i>Acacia Catechu</i>, of which the
following account is given by Mr. H. A. Latham<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1479src" href="#xd21e1479" name="xd21e1479src">31</a> of the
Forest Department. &ldquo;In South Canara, one of our most profitable
sources of revenue is the extract obtained by boiling the wood of the
catechu tree. The tree is confined to the laterite plateaux in the
Coondapur t&#257;luk, situated as a rule within 15 miles of the sea,
and gradually dies out as we proceed southwards, until near Coondapur
itself the tree will hardly grow. It appears again to a small extent in
the Kasaragod t&#257;luk 80 miles further south, but no extraction is
done there now. The extract is astringent, and, besides the other uses
it is put to, it appears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>to be a remedy for diarrh&oelig;a,
dysentery, and diabetes. It is, however, chiefly used for chewing with
p&#257;n sup&#257;ri. Locally, it is used pure in small pieces, the
size of a pea, and rolled up with the other ingredients in the betel
leaf to form a chew. In Mysore, the catechu bought by the merchants
from us is dissolved in water, and the areca-nut is, after being boiled
and sliced, steeped in the solution, and then put out in the sun on
mats to dry, this operation being repeated until sufficient catechu has
been taken up to form a red, shining, semi-transparent film, through
which the ruminated albumen of the areca-nut is just visible; the
brighter the red colour so obtained, the better the quality of the nut.
As we sell it, the catechu is in the shape of hard round balls covered
with a whitish dust, the ashes with which the balls are covered to
prevent them adhering to one another. On breaking, the interior of the
balls should show a vitreous conchoidal fracture similar to quartz, and
be of a warm reddish brown colour. The manufacture of catechu is
carried out under departmental supervision by a contractor, who is paid
on the outturn, and is bound, for the actual boiling, to employ only
Kudubis. So far as the department is concerned, a locality where there
are plenty of catechu trees is selected, and all trees over 6 inches in
diameter are allowed to be cut. The contractor has to engage the
Kudubis and select the site for the ovens, conveniently situated both
for water and firewood, and also as close to the majority of catechu
trees as he can get it. The site usually selected is a rice field, for
which the contractor may have to pay a small rent. Generally, however,
no rent is charged, as the owner is only too glad to have the ashes,
obtained in extracting, to plough into his field. On this field the
encampment is made, consisting of rows of thatched huts made of grass
and bamboos. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>The first thing to do is to erect the ovens,
known as wolle. These are made by a party of men a fortnight or so
before the main body come. The ordinary soil of the field is used, and
the ovens are built to a height of 18 inches, and placed about 5 yards
in front of the huts at irregular distances, 1 or 2 to each hut. The
oven is an oblong, about 2 feet wide by 3 feet long, with two openings
above about 1 foot in diameter, on which the boilers, common ovoid
earthenware pots (madike) are placed. The opening for the fire is
placed on the windward side, and extends to the far side of the second
opening in the top of the oven, the smoke, etc., escaping through the
spaces between the boilers and the oven. The earth forms the hearth. To
proceed to the details of the working, the guard and the watcher go out
the first thing in the morning, and mark trees for the Kudubis to cut,
noting the name of the man, the girth and length of the workable stem
and branches. The Kudubi then cuts the tree, and chips off the sapwood,
a ring about 1 inch wide, with his axe, and brings it into the camp,
where a Forester is stationed, who measures the length and girth of the
pieces, and takes the weight of wood brought in. The Kudubi then takes
it off to his shelter, and proceeds to chip it. In the afternoon he may
have to go and get firewood, but generally he can get enough firewood
in a day to serve for several days&rsquo; boiling. So much for the
men&rsquo;s work. Mrs. Kudubi puts the chips (chakkai) into the pot
nearest the mouth of the oven, and fills it up with water, putting a
large flat wooden spoon on the top, partly to keep the chips down, and,
lighting her fire, allows it to boil. As soon as this occurs, the pot
is tipped into a wooden trough (marige) placed alongside the oven, and
the pot with the chips is refilled. This process is repeated six times.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>The contents of the trough are put into the
second pot, which is used purely for evaporating. The contents of this
pot are replenished from the trough with a cocoanut bailer (chippu)
until all the extract obtained from the chips has been evaporated to a
nearly solid residue. The contents are then poured into a broken half
pot, and allowed to dry naturally, being stirred at intervals to enable
the drying to proceed evenly. The extract (rasa) is of a yellowish
brown colour when stirred, the surface being of rich red-brown. This
stirring is done with a one-sided spoon (satuga). To make the balls,
the woman covers her hands with a little wood ash to prevent the
extract adhering to them, and takes up as much catechu as she can close
her hands on, and presses it into shape. These balls are paid for at
Rs. 1&ndash;2&ndash;0 per 100, and are counted before the Forester next
morning, and delivered to the contractor. This ends the work done by
the Kudubis. When the balls have been counted, they are rolled by
special men engaged for the purpose on a board sprinkled with a little
wood ash, and this is repeated daily for three or four days to
consolidate them. After this daily rolling, the balls are spread out in
the receiving shed to dry, in a single layer for the first day or two,
and after that they may be in two layers. After the fourth or fifth
day&rsquo;s rolling, they are put in a pit, and covered with wood ashes
on which a little water is poured, and, on being taken out the next
day, are gone over, and all balls which are soft or broken are then
rejected, the good ones being put on the upper storey of the stone shed
to get quite hard and dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the commencement of operations, the Kudubis select an
<i>Areca Catechu</i> tree, and place a sword, an axe, and a cocoanut on
the ground near it. They prostrate themselves before the tree, with
hands uplifted, burn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106"
name="pb106">106</a>]</span>incense, and break cocoanuts. The success
of the operations is believed to depend on the good will of a deity
named Sidd&#275;d&#275;varu. Before the Kudubis commence work, they
pray to him, and make a vow that, if they are successful, they will
offer a fowl. Failure to produce good balls of catechu is attributed to
the wrath of the deity. At the close of the work, if it has prospered,
a kalasam (brass vessel) is set up, and fowls are killed. Sometimes,
goats are sacrificed, cooked food and meat are placed on leaves round
the kalasam, and after worshipping, the viands are partaken of.</p>
<p>Like some other castes, the Kudubis do not eat new rice until after
the Hosthu (new crop) festival. Just before reaping, a few plants are
plucked, laid in the field, and worshipped. The ears are then cut, and
carried to their houses, where they are tied to pillars or to the
roof.</p>
<p>There are, among the Kudubis, magicians called Gardi, who are sought
after during illness. To show his magical skill, a Gardi should be able
to cut a single grain of rice in twain with a big knife.</p>
<p><b>Kuduguduk&#257;ran.</b>&mdash;The Kuduguduk&#257;rans or

<p><b>Kudumi or Kudumikkar.</b>&mdash;The Kudumis are mainly found in
the sea-board taluks of Par&#363;r, Shertally, and Ambalapuzha, in
Travancore. The name is believed to be a corruption of the Sanskrit
Kudumbi, meaning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107"
name="pb107">107</a>]</span>one connected with a family. By others it
is derived from a Konkani word, meaning S&#363;dra. The popular name
for the caste is Idiya (pounder), in reference to the occupation of
pounding rice. Kadiya, apparently derived from Ghatiyal, or a person
possessed, is a term of reproach. The title Chetti is now assumed by
members of the caste. But the well-known title is M&#363;ppan, or
elder, conferred on some respectable families by former R&#257;jas of
Cochin. The authority of the Trippanithoray M&#363;ppan is supreme in
all matters relating to the government of the caste. But his authority
has passed, in Travancore, to the Turav&#363;r M&#363;ppan, who has
supreme control over the twenty-two villages of Kudimis. The belief
that the M&#363;ppans differ from the rest of the Kudimis, so as to
make them a distinct sept, does not appear to be based on fact. Nor is
it true that the M&#363;ppans represent the most ancient families of
Konkana S&#363;dras, who emigrated to K&#275;rala independently of the
Konkanis. Chief among them is the Koratti M&#363;ppan of
Trippanithoray, who has, among other privileges, those of the drinking
vessel and lighted lamp conferred on him by the Cochin rulers. Every
Kudumi village has a local M&#363;ppan. A few families enjoy the
surname Kammatti, which is believed to be of agricultural origin.</p>
<p>The Kudumis speak a corrupt form of the Konkani dialect of
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1523" title=
"Source: Marathi">Mar&#257;thi</span>. They are the descendants of
these Konkana S&#363;dras, who emigrated from Goa on account of the
persecutions of the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, and sought
refuge along with their masters, the Konkana Br&#257;hmans, on the
coast of Travancore and Cochin. Most of them set out as the domestic
servants of the latter, but a few were independent traders and
agriculturists. Two varieties of rice grain, chethivirippu and
malarnellu, brought by them from the Konkan, are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>still sown in Travancore. One of the earliest
occupations, in which they engaged, was the manufacture of fireworks,
and, as they were bold and sturdy, they were enlisted as soldiers by
the chieftains of Malabar. Relics of the existence of military
training-grounds are still to be found in many of their houses.</p>
<p>On a raised mud platform in the court-yard of the Kudumi&rsquo;s
house, the tulasi (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>) or p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus
religiosa</i>) is invariably grown. Fish and flesh, except beef, are
eaten, and intoxicating liquor is rather freely imbibed. The women wear
coloured cloths, usually black, and widows are not obliged to be clad
in white. A gold mukkutti is an indispensable nose ornament. Tattooing
is largely resorted to by the women.</p>
<p>The occupation of the Kudumis is service in the houses of the
Konkana Br&#257;hmans. They also prepare beaten rice, act as boatmen,
porters, and agricultural labourers, clean tanks and wells, and thatch
houses. The M&#363;ppans manufacture, and give displays of fireworks,
which have a local reputation at the great Konkani temple of
Turav&#363;r in the Shertallay taluk.</p>
<p>They worship at the temples of the Konkana Br&#257;hmans, as well as
their own. But they are not pronounced Vaishnavites, like the
Br&#257;hmans, as the teachings of Madhv&#257;ch&#257;rya did not reach
the lower ranks of Hinduism. On Sunday only one meal is taken. Maddu or
Madan is their chief minor deity, and water-sheds are erected to
propitiate him. Brahma is adored for nine days in the month of Kumbham
(February-March) from the full-moon day. The p&#299;pal tree is
scrupulously worshipped, and a lighted lamp placed beside it every
evening.</p>
<p>A woman, at the menstrual period, is considered impure for four
days, and she stands at a distance of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>seven feet, closing
her mouth and nostrils with the palm of the hand, as the breath of such
a woman is believed to have a contaminating effect. Her shadow, too,
should not fall on any one. The marriage of girls should take place
before puberty. Violation of this rule would be punished by the
excommunication of the family. During the marriage ceremony, the tulasi
plant is worshipped, and the bride and bridegroom husk a small quantity
of rice. The mother of the bridegroom prepares a new oven within the
house, and places a new pot beside it. The contracting couple, assisted
by five women, throw five handfuls of rice into the pot, which is
cooked. They then put a quantity of paddy (unhusked rice) into a
mortar, and after carefully husking it, make rice flour from it. A
quantity of betel and rice is then received by the bride and bridegroom
from four women. The t&#257;li is tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck by
the bridegroom, and one of his companions then takes a thread, and
fastens it to their legs. On the fifth day of the marriage rites, a
piece of cloth, covering the breasts, is tied round the bride&rsquo;s
neck, and the nose is pierced for the insertion of the mukkutti.</p>
<p>Inheritance is generally from father to son (makkath&#257;yam), but,
in a few families, marumakkath&#257;yam (inheritance through the female
line) is observed. Widow remarriage is common, and the bridegroom is
generally a widower. Only the oldest members of a family are cremated,
the corpses of others being buried. The Kudumis own a common
burial-ground in all places, where they reside in large numbers.
Pollution lasts for sixteen days.</p>
<p>The Kudumis and the indigenous S&#363;dras of Travancore do not
accept food from each other. They never wear the sacred thread, and may
not enter the inner <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span>courtyard of a Br&#257;hmanical temple.
They remove pollution by means of water sprinkled over them by a
Konkana Br&#257;hman. Their favourite amusement is the koladi, in which
ten or a dozen men execute a figure dance, armed with sticks, which
they strike together keeping time to the music of songs relating to
Krishna, and Bhagavati.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1551src" href=

<p><b>Kudumi.</b>&mdash;Concerning the Kudumi medicine-men. I
gather<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1558src" href="#xd21e1558" name=
"xd21e1558src">33</a> that &ldquo;the Kudumi is a necessary adjunct to
the village. His office implies a more or less intimate acquaintance
with the curative herbs and roots in the forests, and their proper
application to the different ailments resulting from venomous bites or
stings. It is the Kudumi who procures leeches for the gouty Reddi or
the phlegmatic Moodeliar, when he finds that some blood-letting will
benefit their health. He prays over sprains and cricks, and binds the
affected parts with the sacred cord made of the hair taken from the
patient&rsquo;s head. He is an expert practitioner at phlebotomy, and
many old Anglo-Indians domiciled in the country will recall the Kudumi
when his services were in demand to heal some troublesome limb by the
letting of blood. This individual is believed to possess a magic
influence over wild animals and snakes, and often comes out in public
as a dexterous snake-charmer. It is principally in the case of
poisonous bites that the Kudumi&rsquo;s skill is displayed. It is
partly by the application of medicinal leaves ground into a paste, and
partly by exercising his magical powers, that he is believed to cure
the most dangerous bites of snakes and other venomous
animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kudumi often belongs to the Irula or J&#333;gi caste.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=

<p><b>Kudumi.</b>&mdash;The kudumi is the tuft of hair, which is left
when the head of Hindus is shaved. &ldquo;For some time past,&rdquo;
Bishop Caldwell writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1568src" href=
"#xd21e1568" name="xd21e1568src">34</a> &ldquo;a considerable number of
European missionaries in the Tamil country have come to regard the
wearing of the tuft as a badge of Hinduism, and hence require the
natives employed in their missions to cut off the kudumi as a <i>sine
qu&acirc; non</i> of their retention of mission employment&rdquo;. The
kudumi, as the Bishop points out, would doubtless have been admired by
our grandfathers, who wore a kudumi themselves, viz., the queue which
followed the wig. &ldquo;The Vellalas of the present day,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;almost invariably wear the kudumi, but they admit
that their forefathers wore their hair long. Some of the Maravars wear
the kudumi, and others do not. It makes a difference in their social
position. The kudumi, which was originally a sign of Aryan nationality,
and then of Aryan respectability, has come to be a sign of
respectability in general, and hence, whilst the poorer Maravars
generally wear their hair long, the wealthier members of the caste
generally wear the kudumi. The Pallars in Tinnevelly used to wear their
hair long, but most of them have recently adopted the kudumi, and the
wearing of the kudumi is now spreading even among the Pariahs. In
short, wherever higher notions of civilization, and a regard for
appearances extend, the use of the kudumi seems to extend also&rdquo;.
Even a Toda has been known to visit the Nanjeng&#333;d temple at the
base of the N&#299;lgiris, to pray for offspring, and return with a
shaved head.</p>

Kumbhak&#257;ra, pot-maker (ku, earth). In social position they are
considered to be a superior class of S&#363;dras. The Telugu Kummaras
were cooks under the ancient kings, and many of them still work in that
capacity in S&#363;dra houses. The Kumb&#257;ros are purely
Vaishnavites and employ Boishnob priests, while the Kummaras and
Kumb&#257;ras call in Br&#257;hmans. Widow <span class=

alone. All of them eat flesh.&rdquo; Concerning the potter classes, Mr.
Stuart writes further<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1636src" href=
"#xd21e1636" name="xd21e1636src">36</a> that &ldquo;Kummaras or
Kusavans (<i>q.v.</i>) are the potters of the country, and were
probably at one time a single caste, but are now divided into Telugus,
Northern Tamilians and Southern Tamilians, who have similar customs,
but will not intermarry or eat together. The northern and southern
potters differ in that the former use a wheel of earthenware, and the
latter one made of wood. The Telugu potters are usually followers of
Vishnu and the Tamilians of Siva, some being also Ling&#257;yats, and
therefore burying their dead. All the potters claim an impure
Br&#257;hmanical descent, telling the following story regarding their
origin. A learned Br&#257;hman, after long study, discovered the day
and hour in which he might beget a mighty offspring. For this
auspicious time he waited long, and at its approach started for the
house of his selected bride, but floods detained him, and, when he
should have been with her, he was stopping in a potter&rsquo;s house.
He was, however, resolved not to lose the opportunity, and by the
daughter of his host he had a son, the celebrated S&#257;liv&#257;hana.
This hero in his infancy developed a genius for pottery, and used to
amuse himself by making earthen figures of mounted warriors, which he
stored in large numbers in a particular place. After a time Vikramarka
invaded Southern India, and ordered the people to supply him with pots
for his army. They applied to S&#257;liv&#257;hana, who miraculously
infused life into his clay figures, and led them to battle against the
enemy, whom he defeated, and the country (Mysore) fell into his hands.
Eventually he was left as its ruler, and became the ancestor of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>early Mysore R&#257;jas. Such is the story
current among the potters, who generally believe that they are his
progeny. They all live in a state of poverty and ignorance, and are
considered of a low rank among other S&#363;dras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the village of Karigeri in the North Arcot district, there is
carried on by some of the local potters an interesting industry in the
manufacture of ornamental pottery, for which a medal was awarded at the
Delhi Darbar Exhibition. &ldquo;The soft pottery,&rdquo;
Surgeon-General G. Bidie writes, &ldquo;receives a pretty green glaze,
and is made into vases and other receptacles, some of which are
imitations of Delft ware and other European manufactures of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; patterns having been introduced by
Collectors.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1646src" href="#xd21e1646" name=
"xd21e1646src">37</a> Some of the water-bottles are double, the outer
shell being pierced so as to allow air to circulate around the
inner.&rdquo; The history of this little industry is, I gather, as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1649src" href="#xd21e1649" name=
"xd21e1649src">38</a> &ldquo;Mr. Robinson, a Collector in the sixties
of the last century, started the manufacture of tea-pots, milk jugs,
and sugar bowls with a dark green glaze, but his dream of supplying all
India with chota hazri (early tea) sets was not realised. Then came Mr.
Whiteside, and the small Grecian vases and the like are due to his and
Mrs. Barlow&rsquo;s influence. He had accurate wooden models made by
his well-known wood-carvers. He further altered the by no means pretty
green glaze, and reddish browns and yellows were produced. Then came
Mr. Stuart, who pushed the sale at exhibitions and railway stations. He
also gave the potters models of fancy flower-pots for in-door use. The
pottery is exceedingly fragile, and unsuitable for rough usage.
Unglazed water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>and butter coolers were the earliest and best
articles the potters produced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Kumb&#257;ras of South Canara, Mr. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1656src" href="#xd21e1656" name=
"xd21e1656src">39</a> that they &ldquo;seem to be a branch of the
Telugu and Canarese potter castes, but many of them have Tulu for their
home speech, and follow the aliyasant&#257;na rule of inheritance (in
the female line). Some of them officiate as p&#363;j&#257;ris (priests)
in the temples of the local deities or demons, and are employed to
perform funeral rites. Unlike the Tamil potters, the Kumb&#257;ras do
not wear the sacred thread. Infant and widow marriages are very common.
On the birth of a child, the family observe pollution for fifteen days,
and on the sixteenth day the village barber and dh&#333;bi (washerman)
get holy water from the village temple, and purify the family by
sprinkling it on their head. There are two endogamous sub-divisions,
the Kannada and Tulu Kumb&#257;ra, and each of these is divided into
exogamous balis. Their ordinary title is Handa, which is also sometimes
used as the name of the caste. In Uppinangadi a superior kind of
pottery is made (by the Kannada Kumb&#257;ras). It is made of clay
powdered, mixed with water, and strained. It is then poured into a pit
specially prepared for the purpose, where it is allowed to remain for
about a month, by which time it becomes quite dry. It is then removed,
powdered, moistened, and made into balls, which are one by one placed
upon a wheel and fashioned into various kinds of vessels, including
vases, goglets, tea-pots, cups and saucers. The vessels are dried in
the shade for about eight days, after which they are baked for two
days, when they are ready for sale. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>They have a glazed
appearance, and are sometimes beautifully ornamented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Census Report, 1901, V&#333;d&#257;ri, Bandi, and M&#363;lya
are returned as sub-castes of the Canarese potters.</p>
<p>The Kumb&#257;ras of the Mysore Province are, Mr. T. Ananda Row
informs us,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1666src" href="#xd21e1666" name=
"xd21e1666src">40</a> &ldquo;potters and tile-makers. There are two
great divisions among them mutually exclusive, the Kannada and Telugu,
the former claiming superiority over the latter. The Telugu
Kumb&#257;ras trace their descent to S&#257;liv&#257;hana, and wear the
sacred thread. They abstain from eating meat. There are both Saivites
and Vaishnavites among Kumb&#257;ras. The former acknowledge the
Smartha Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s sway. Polygamy is permitted, and divorce
can only be for adultery. Widows are not permitted to remarry. This
caste also includes dyers known as N&#299;lagara (n&#299;l, indigo). It
is curious that these two trades, quite distinct from one another, are
followed by persons of the same family according to inclination. The
Kumb&#257;ras worship all the Hindu deities, but pay special reverence
to their kiln. They are recognised members of the village
hierarchy.&rdquo; Of the Mysore Kumb&#257;ras, Mr. L. Rice
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1669src" href="#xd21e1669" name=
"xd21e1669src">41</a> that the &ldquo;pot-makers were not stationed in
every village, one or two being generally sufficient for a hobli or
taraf. He furnished pots for all the ryats (agriculturists) of his
taraf, and was entitled to ayam in an equal proportion as the other
Ayagar (hereditary village officers). For liberty of exposing his wares
for sale to travellers in the markets, he paid chakra-kanke to the
Sirkar (Government).&rdquo; At Channapatna, in Mysore, I purchased for
three annas a large collection of articles <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>of
pottery made out of black and brown clay. They are said to be made at a
village near Channapatna, and consist of rudely ornamented miniature
lamps of various patterns, models of native kitchen-ranges, pots,
tobacco-pipes, dishes, etc. At the Mysore census, 1891, some potters
described themselves as Gundu (round) Br&#257;hmans.</p>
<p>The Oriya Kumb&#257;ro (kumbho, a pot) are said to practice both
infant and adult marriage, and to permit the remarriage of widows. A
sub-caste, named Bhande, derives its name from the Sanskrit bhanda, a
pot. The Madras Museum possesses a quaint series of painted clay
figures, made by a potter at Venkatarayapalle in Ganjam, which are set
up in shrines on the seashore, and worshipped by fishermen. They
include the following:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Beng&#257;li B&#257;bu.</i>&mdash;Wears a hat, and rides on a
black horse. He blesses the fishermen, secures large hauls of fish for
them, and guards them against danger when out fishing.</p>
<p><i>R&#257;jamma.</i>&mdash;A female figure, with a sword in her
right hand, riding on a black elephant. She blesses barren women with
children, and favours her devotees with big catches when they go out
fishing.</p>
<p><i>Veyyi Kannalu Ammavaru</i>, or the goddess of a thousand eyes,
represented by a pot pierced with many holes, in which a gingelly
(<i>Sesamum</i>) oil light is burnt. She attends to the general welfare
of the fishing folk.</p>

<p><b>Kunchigar.</b>&mdash;The Kunchigars, Kunchitigas, or
Kunchiliyans, are a class of cultivators in the Salem district, who
speak Canarese, and have migrated southward to the Tamil country. Their
tradition concerning their origin is that &ldquo;a certain Naw&#257;b,
who lived north of the Tungabadra river, sent a peon (orderly) to
search for gh&#299; (clarified butter), twelve years old. In his
travels south of the river, the peon met a lovely maid drawing water,
who supplied his want. Struck by her beauty, he watched her bathing
place, and stole one hair which fell from her head in bathing, which he
took to the Naw&#257;b. The latter conceived the idea of marrying the
girl, and sent an embassy, which was so far successful that the girl
and her family came to his residence, and erected a marriage pandal
(booth). Subsequently they repented, and, thinking that the marriage
would be a m&eacute;salliance (the Naw&#257;b was probably a
Muhammadan), fled in the night, leaving a dog in the pandal. In their
flight they came to the Tungabadra, which was in full flood, and,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>eager to escape, they consented to marry the
maiden to a Kurumban who ferried them across the river. The Kunchigars
are the descendants of this girl and the Kurumban. When running away
they, in their haste, forgot a little girl, and left her behind them.
She was seized by the Naw&#257;b, who thirsted for vengeance, and
thrown into the air so as to fall on knives placed so as to transfix
her. Some miracle interposed to save her, and the Ar&#275; Kunchigars
of Mysore are her descendants.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p><b>Kunnuvan.</b>&mdash;The Kunnuvans are described, in the Gazetteer

the Palni hills. They speak Tamil. Their own traditions say that their
ancestors were Vell&#257;lans from the Dh&#257;r&#257;puram and
K&#257;ngayam country in Coimbatore, who went up the Palnis some four
or five centuries ago because the low country was so disturbed by war
(other accounts say devastated by famine), and they call themselves
Kunnuva Vell&#257;las, and state that the name Kunnuva is derived from
Kunn&#363;r village in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=

that the Vir&#363;p&#257;kshi and Ayyakudi poligars (feudal chieftains)
helped them to settle on their land in the hills, which up to then had
only been cultivated by indolent Pulaiyans. The Kunnuvans ousted these
latter, and eventually turned them into predial serfs&mdash;a position
from which they have hardly yet freed themselves. In every village is a
headman, called the Mann&#257;di, who has the usual powers. The caste
is divided into three endogamous sections, called Vaguppus, namely,
Periya (big) Kunnuvar, Kunnuvar, and Chinna (little) Kunnuvar. They
will eat together. The dress of the women is characteristic. They wear
rough metal necklets, brass bangles and anklets, silver bangles on
their upper arms, and rings in their noses; and they knot their upper
cloths in front across the breasts, and bind them round their waists in
a sort of bandage. White cloths used to be forbidden them, but are
common enough nowadays. [It was noted by Mr. M. J. Walhouse, in
1881,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1762src" href="#xd21e1762" name=
"xd21e1762src">43</a> in connection with the Kuneivar on the lower
slopes of the Palnis, that women were never allowed to wear white
clothes. None could tell why, but it was said that, within memory,
women offending against the rule had been cast from a high rock.] The
claim of a man to his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter is rigidly
maintained, and the evasions of the rule allowed by other castes when
the ages of the parties are disproportionate are not permitted.
Consequently, a boy sometimes marries more than one of these cousins of
his, and, until he reaches manhood, those of them who are much older
than he is live with other men of the caste, the boy being the nominal
father of any children which may be born. A boy of nine or ten may thus
be the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>putative father of a child of two or three. [In
this connection, Mr. J. H. Nelson writes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1767src" href="#xd21e1767" name="xd21e1767src">44</a> that Madura
Collectors have sometimes been puzzled not a little by evidence adduced
to show that a child of three or four years was the son or daughter of
a child of ten or twelve.] When a man has no children except a girl,
and his family is in danger of coming to an end, a curious practice,
called keeping up the house, is followed. The girl cannot be claimed by
her maternal uncle&rsquo;s son as usual, but may be married to one of
the door-posts of the house. A silver bangle is put on her right wrist
instead of a tali (marriage badge) round her neck; she is allowed to
consort with any man of her caste; her earnings go to her parents; she
becomes their heir, and, if she has a son, the boy inherits their
property through her. The custom is a close parallel to the system of
making girls Basavis, which is so common in the western part of Bellary
and the neighbouring parts of Dharwar and Mysore. Divorce is readily
obtained, on the petitioner paying the amount of the bride-price, but
the children all go to the father. Divorc&eacute;es and widows may
remarry, and they do so with a frequency which has made the caste a
byword among its neighbours. The Kunnuvans worship the usual deities of
the plains. They generally burn their dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Manual of the Madura district, that the
Kunnuvans of the western parts of the Palni hills differ in many of
their customs from those of the eastern. With both divisions,
incompatibility of temper is a sufficient ground for divorce, and a
husband can at any time get rid of his wife by taking her to her
parents together with a pair of oxen if he be an eastern Kunnuvan, and
a vatti or round metal dish if he be a western. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>On
the other hand, if the wife dislikes her partner, she may leave him
upon giving up her golden jewels&mdash;the silver she retains&mdash;and
may, according to her pleasure, either go back to her father&rsquo;s
house, or marry another man. In the west, however, she takes with her
only such property as she may have possessed at the time of her
marriage. Her children must all be made over to the deserted husband;
and, if she be pregnant when she goes away, and a child be born while
she is living with her second husband, it must nevertheless be given up
to the first, upon payment of the expense of rearing it if in the east,
upon mere demand in the west. In this way a woman may legally marry any
number of men in succession, though she may not have two husbands at
one and the same time. She may, however, bestow favours on paramours
without hindrance, provided they be of equal caste with her. On the
other hand, a man may indulge in polygamy to any extent he pleases, and
the wealthier Kunnuvans keep several wives as servants, especially for
agricultural purposes. The religion of the Kunnuvans appear to be the
Saiva, but they worship their mountain god Valapan with far more
devotedness than any other.</p>
<p>The name Kunnuvan is derived by Mr. Nelson from kunru, a hill.</p>
<p><b>Kunta.</b>&mdash;A division of Kuravas of Travancore, who derive

<p><b>Kurava.</b>&mdash;For the following note on the Kuravas of
Travancore, I am indebted to Mr. N. Subramani Aiyar. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are more than 50,000 Kuravas in Travancore, of whom the
largest numbers live in the t&#257;luks of Kunnatur, Chirayinkil, and
Kottarakkara. They were originally divided into four branches, called
Kunta Kuravan, P&#363;m Kuravan, K&#257;kka Kuravan, and P&#257;ndi
Kuravan. Almost all the Kuravas of this country belong to the first of
these sections. The P&#363;m Kuravas are believed to have become a
different caste, called V&#275;lan. Similarly, the K&#257;kka Kuravans
have crystallised into a distinct caste named Kakkalan. P&#257;ndi
Kuravas speak Tamil, and are chiefly found in Nanchinad, being there
known as Nanchi Kuravas. The Kunta Kuravas attribute the origin of
their name to the appearance of their first ancestor from a sacrificial
altar (h&#333;makunta). They are known in some places, such as
Nedumangad, by the name of Muli Kuravas, probably because they emit a
drawling noise when called. It has been suggested that the Kuravas are
one of the early tribes of Southern India, and one with the Kurumbas of
the Tamil country, and closely allied to the V&#275;dans. Such of them
as still preserve their old practices, and do not mingle with the
low-country people, are known as Malan Kuravas. They form one of the
sixteen hill-tribes mentioned in the K&#275;ralolpatti. About three
centuries ago, Nanchinad in Travancore was governed by a line of Kurava
kings, called Nanchi Kuravans.</p>
<p>The Kuravas are pr&aelig;dial slaves, who were liable in olden days
to be bought and sold along with the land they occupied. They are not
regarded as so faithful as the Pulayas. Their homes are, like those of
the Pulayas, low thatched sheds. They eat meat, and drink toddy and
arrack. Their women tie their hair in the centre of the head, and not
behind like the Pulayas. Tattooing is very largely resorted to.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>Though Hindu deities are worshipped, the Chavars, or spirits of the
dead, receive the most particular attention. The days considered to be
of religious importance are &#332;nam in the month of Chingam, the
Ailiyam and Makam stars in Kanni, the 28th of Makaram, the Bharani star
in Kumbham and Minam, and the first day of Audi. The special deities of
the Kuravas are called K&#257;tiyatikal or mountain gods, whom they
worship on these days with an offering. On the 30th of each month, and
on days of festivity, all the Kuravas take beaten rice and toddy, and
offer them with a view to propitiating their ancestors. Small sheds are
dedicated to Chavars, where the priest, called Piniyali or sorcerer, is
the only important person. The Kuravas have among themselves a special
class of exorcisers, whom they call Rarakkar (literally Vicharakkar),
or those who make enquiries about the occurrence of diseases. The
Rarakkaran first becomes possessed, and cries out the names of all the
mountain deities in the vicinity, violently shaking every limb of his
body as he does so. Some of these deities are Chavar, Ayiravalli,
Chattan, Pakavati, Matan, Murti, Taivam, Pakavan, Appuppan, and Maruta.
He then takes a handful of paddy (unhusked rice) from a quantity placed
in front of him, and, after counting, decides, upon the chance of one
or two grains remaining in the end after each of them is removed,
whether some one in the house is not attacked by, or liable to the
attack of some evil spirit. The same process is repeated, in order to
find out the proper remedy for appeasing them. The Rarakkaran at the
end proceeds out of the house in a northerly direction. The
&#362;r&#257;li, or headman of Peruvirutti Mala in Kunnattur, becomes
possessed on the evening of the third Monday of Minam, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>and
foretells coming events for such Kuravas as are assembled.</p>
<p>The headmen of the Kuravas are called &#362;r&#257;li and Panikkan,
and they must be paid a fee of not less than ten chuckrams on all
religious occasions. The priest is known as Kaikkaran.</p>
<p>The Kuravas observe two forms of marriage ceremonial, viz., the
t&#257;li-kettu before puberty, and sambandham. At the former, an
elderly Kuratti (Kurava woman) ties the minnu or wedding ornament round
the neck of the girl. When a Kurava wishes to marry a girl, he must pay
twelve fanams to her maternal uncle. Widows remarry, and divorce,
though void without the consent of the headmen, is easily effected. The
form of inheritance is marumakkath&#257;yam (in the female line).</p>
<p>The dead are buried, and death pollution is observed for twelve
days.</p>
<p>The Kuravas are obliged to stand, according to some at forty-eight,
and according to others at sixty-four paces from a high-caste Hindu.
They regard themselves as higher in the social scale than Pulaiyas and
Paraiyans.</p>
<p><b>Kuravan.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report,
1901, as a sub-division of N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Kur&#275;shi.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as a territorial name returned by Muhammadans, Kur&#275;shi being
a village in Arabia; also one of the sub-divisions of the Nav&#257;yat
tribe.</p>
<p><b>Kuricchan.</b>&mdash;The Kuricchans, or Kuricchiyans, are
described by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1824src" href=
"#xd21e1824" name="xd21e1824src">45</a> as &ldquo;the hunting caste of
Malabar. Some derive the word from kurikke, to mark or assign, as they
say that this caste fixed the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126"
href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>hunting days. This must be
the production of a highly imaginative person. Dr. Gundert thinks it is
derived from, or allied to, Canarese Koracha (Korava). I would rather
say it is allied to that word, and that both are derivatives of kuru, a
hill (<i>cf.</i> Tamil kurinchi), kurunilam, etc., and Malay&#257;lam
kurissi, a suffix in names of hilly localities. With the exception of
2,240 persons in Kottayam, and 373 in Kurumbran&#257;d, both bordering
on Wynaad, all the Kuricchans are found in Wynaad. They are excellent
bowmen, and played an important part in the Pyche R&#257;ja&rsquo;s
rebellion at the beginning of the (nineteenth) century. The Kuricchans
affect a great contempt for Br&#257;hmans. When a Br&#257;hman has been
in a Kuricchan&rsquo;s house, the moment he leaves it, the place where
he was seated is besmeared with cowdung to remove the pollution! They
follow inheritance in the male line in some places, and in the female
line in others. Their god is called M&#363;ttappan, which literally
means grandfather. They now subsist mostly by punam (shifting)
cultivation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Gazetteer of Malabar, the Kuricchiyans (kuricchi, hill
country) are described as &ldquo;a jungle tribe of punam cultivators,
found in the Wynaad and the slopes of the ghats, north of Calicut. They
consider themselves polluted by the approach of other hill tribes and
by the touch of Tiyans and Kamm&#257;lans; and their women require
water sanctified by a Br&#257;hman to purify them. They perform the
t&#257;li kettu ceremony before puberty, and say that they follow the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1834" title=
"Source: marumakkatt&#257;yam">marumakkath&#257;yam</span> family
system (of inheritance in the female line), though the wife usually
goes to live with her husband in a new hut, and the husband has to pay
a price for his bride. They act as oracles during the great festival at
K&#333;ttiyur. The performer becomes inspired after sitting for some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>time gazing into a vessel containing gingelly
oil, and holding in his hand a curious-shaped wand of gold about a foot
and a half long, and hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. Logan,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1841src"
href="#xd21e1841" name="xd21e1841src">46</a> in connection with a
disturbance in Malabar early in the last century, that &ldquo;the first
overt act occurred at Panamaram in Wyn&#257;d. Some five days previous
to 11th October 1802, one of the proscribed rebel leaders, Edachenna
Kungan, chanced to be present at the house of a Kurchiyan, when a
belted peon came up, and demanded some paddy (rice) from the Kurchiyan.
Edachenna Kungan replied by killing the peon, and the Kurchiyans (a
jungle tribe) in that neighbourhood, considering themselves thus
compromised with the authorities, joined Edachenna Kungan. This band,
numbering about 150, joined by Edachenna Kungan and his two brothers,
then laid their plans for attacking the military post at Panamaram,
held by a detachment of 70 men of the 1st Battalion of the 4th Bombay
Infantry under Captain Dickenson and Lieutenant Maxwell. They first
seized sentry&rsquo;s musket, and killed him with arrows. Captain
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1844" title=
"Source: Dikenson">Dickenson</span> killed and wounded with his
pistols, bayonet, and sword, 15 of the Kurchiyars, 5 of whom died. The
whole of the detachment was massacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on an inspection of a Kuriccha settlement, Mr. F. Fawcett
recorded that the houses were close to some rice-fields cultivated by
the Kuricchas. The M&#257;ppillas, however, took the crop as interest
on an outstanding debt. One house was noted as having walls of wattle
and mud, a thatched roof, and verandah. In the eastern verandah were a
bow and arrows, a fresh head of paddy (unhusked rice), some withered
grain, etc., <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>dedicated to the god M&#363;ttappan. A man
requested Mr. Fawcett not to approach a hut, in which a meal was being
cooked, as he would pollute it. A child, a few months old, with a ring
in each ear, and a ring of shell or bone on a string to avert the evil
eye, was lying in a cradle suspended from the roof. Both by Mr. Fawcett
and others, the Kuricchas are given the character of remarkably
innocent, truthful, and trustworthy people.</p>
<p>For the following note, I am indebted to Mr. E. Fernandez. The
Kuricchas usually live by cultivation, but it is considered a great
stroke of good luck to obtain a post as postal runner or amsham peon.
When on a hunting expedition, they are armed with bows and arrows, or
occasionally with guns, and surround a hill. Some of them then enter
the jungle with dogs, and drive the game, which is killed by the dogs,
or shot with arrows or bullets. The flesh of the spoil is divided up
between the sylvan deity, the jenmi (landlord), the dogs, the man who
put the first arrow or bullet into the animal, and the other Kuricchas.
In some places, the Kuricchas use arrows for shooting fresh-water fish.
The principle is described by Mr. Fawcett as being the same as in the
Greenlander&rsquo;s spear, and the dart used with a blow-pipe on the
west coast for catching sharks.</p>
<p>From Malabar I have received two forms of blowpipe, used for killing
fish, birds, and small game. In one, the tube consists of a piece of
straight slender bamboo about 4&prime; 6&Prime; in length; the other,
which is about 7&prime; in length, is made from the stem of the areca
palm. In the latter, two pieces of the stem are placed face to face, so
that a complete tube is made. Round the exterior, thin cloth or
tree-bark, steeped in gum, is tightly wrapped, so that the two halves
are kept together. Sometimes the blow-pipe is decorated with painted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>designs. The arrow consists of a reed shaft and
iron arrow-head, which, by means of a socket, fits loosely on the
conical end of the shaft. A piece of string, several feet long, is tied
round the arrow-head, and wound closely round the shaft. When the arrow
is discharged from the tube, and enters, for example, the body of a
fish, the string is uncoiled from the shaft, which floats on the
surface of the water, and points out the position of the fish, which is
hauled up.</p>
<p>A Paniyan, Adiyan, Kurumba, or Pulayan, approaching within a
recognised distance of a Kuriccha, conveys pollution, which must be
removed by a bath, holy water, and the recitation of mantrams
(consecrated formul&aelig;). The Kuricchas address Br&#257;hmans as
Tambrakal, and N&#257;yars as Tamburan. They are themselves addressed
by Paniyans and Adiyans as Acchan and P&#257;ppan, by J&#275;n Kurumbas
as M&#363;ttappan, and by Pulayans as Perumannom.</p>
<p>In addition to M&#363;ttappan, the Kuricchas worship various other
deities, such as Karimbil Bhagavathi, Malakurathi, and Athirallan. No
animal sacrifices are performed, but each family celebrates annually a
ceremony called Kollu Kodukal, for which the Pittan (head of the
family) fixes an auspicious day. The temple is cleaned, and smeared
with cow-dung, and holy water is sprinkled, to remove all pollution.
Those who attend at the ceremony bathe before proceeding to the temple,
which is lighted with oil-lamps. Cocoanuts, sugar-candy, plantains,
beaten rice, a measure (edangali) full of rice, and another full of
paddy, are placed before the lamps, and offered to the deity by the
Pittan. One of the community becomes possessed, and gives forth
oracular utterances. Finally he falls down, and the deity is supposed
to have left him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130"
name="pb130">130</a>]</span>The offerings are distributed among those
who have assembled.</p>
<p>The management of tribal affairs is vested in the Pittans of the
different families, and the final appellate authority is the Kottayath
R&#257;ja, who authorises certain N&#257;yars to hear appeals on his
behalf.</p>
<p>The Kuricchas celebrate the t&#257;li-kettu kaly&#257;nam. Marriages
are arranged by the Pittans. The wedding is a very simple affair. The
bridegroom brings a pair of cloths and rings made of white metal or
brass as a present for the bride, and a feast is held.</p>
<p><b>Kurivi</b> (sparrow).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Kurni.</p>
<p><b>K&#363;rma</b> (tortoise).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Nagar&#257;lu.
The equivalent Kurum is recorded as a sept of Pentiya.</p>
<p><b>K&#363;rmapu.</b>&mdash;The Kurmapuv&#257;llu are women, in the
Vizagapatam district, who have not entered into matrimony, but earn
money by prostitution, and acting as dancers at feasts. They are so
called from the fact that they were originally dancing-girls attached
to the temple of Sr&#299; K&#363;rmam, a place of pilgrimage in
Vizagapatam.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1880src" href="#xd21e1880"
name="xd21e1880src">47</a></p>
<p><b>Kurni.</b>&mdash;The name Kurni is, according to the Census
Report, 1901, &ldquo;a corruption of kuri (sheep) and vanni (wool), the
caste having been originally weavers of wool. They now weave cotton and
silk, and also cultivate. They have two main sub-divisions, Hir&#275;
(big) and Chikka (small). The Hir&#275;s are all Ling&#257;yats, and
are said to have sixty-six totemistic septs or g&#333;tras. They employ
Jangams as priests, and also men of their own caste, who are called
Chittik&#257;ras. They will mess with the non-Ling&#257;yat section,
and with Ling&#257;yats of other castes. They do not eat meat, or smoke
or drink alcohol, but the Chikkas do all three. Marriage before puberty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>is the rule in the caste. Divorces are
permitted. Widows may marry again, but have to spend two nights alone
at two different temples. Their wedding ceremonies are carried out by
widows only, and the woman is not afterwards allowed to take part in
religious or family observances.&rdquo; A synonym of both Kurnis and
D&#275;v&#257;ngas is J&#257;da or J&#257;ndra, meaning great men. A
further synonym of the Kurnis is said to be Kunigiri. The term
N&#275;se, meaning weaver, is applied to several of the weaving castes,
including the Kurnis.</p>
<p>The following extract is taken from an appeal for subscriptions in
aid of the publication of the Bhavishyottara Pur&#257;na by the Kurnis
in a village in the Bellary district. &ldquo;Greetings from all the
Kuruhine Setti V&#299;rasaivas residing in Hirihala village of Bellary
t&#257;luk. The wish of the writers is that all, old and young, should
rejoice in the sixty-six g&#333;tras, sixty-six r&#363;dras, and
sixty-six rishis. He who reads the order of these sixty-six g&#333;tras
of the Kuruhina Settis will enter Sivaloka. His twenty-one generations
will attain to the position of g&#257;nas (attendants) of Sivaloka.
Such was the order of &#298;swara. This is the end of the chapter in
the N&#299;lakantha Mallikarj&#363;na Bhavishyat pur&#257;na acquired
by Shanmukha from the &#298;swara shruti of the Harav&#257;tula.&rdquo;
The g&#333;tras are described as being of the Br&#257;hman, Kshatriya,
and Vaisya sub-divisions of the caste, and of Shanmukha&rsquo;s
S&#363;dra caste:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Kuruba.</b>&mdash;Though plucky in hunting bears and leopards,
the Kurubas at Hospet were exceedingly fearful of myself and my
methods, and were only partially ingratiated by an offer of a money
prize at one of the wrestling combats, in which they delight, and of
which I had a private exhibition. The wrestlers, some of whom were
splendid specimens of muscularity, had, I noticed, the moustache
clipped short, and hair clean shaved at the back of the head, so that
there was none for the adversary to grip. One man, at the entreaties of
an angry spouse, was made to offer up the silver coin, presented by me
in return for the loan of his body for measurement, as bad money at the
shrine of Udachallama, together with two annas of his own as a
peace-offering to the goddess. The wives of two men (brothers), who
came to me for measurement, were left sobbing in the village. One, at
the last moment, refused to undergo the operation, on the principle
that one should be taken, and the other left. A man was heard, at
question time, to mutter &ldquo;Why, when we are hardworking and poor,
do we keep our hair, while this rich and lazy S&#257;hib has gone
bald?&rdquo; Another (I believe, the tame village <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>lunatic) was more complimentary, and exclaimed
&ldquo;We natives are the betel leaf and nut. You, Sir, are the chunam
(lime), which makes them perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the Kurubas wear charms in the form of a string of black
sheep&rsquo;s wool, or thread tied round the arm or neck, sometimes
with sacred ashes wrapped inside, as a vow to some minor deity, or a
four anna piece to a superior deity. A priest wore a necklet of
rudr&#257;ksha (<i>El&aelig;ocarpus Ganitrus</i>) beads, and a silver
box, containing the material for making the sacred marks on the
forehead, pendent from a loin string. His child wore a similar necklet,
a copper ornament engraved with cabalistic devices, and silver plate
bearing a figure of Hanum&#257;n, as all his other children had died,
and a piece of pierced pottery from the burial-ground, to ward off
whooping-cough, suspended round the neck. In colour-scale the Kurubas
vary enormously, from very dark to light brown. The possessor of the
fairest skin, and the greatest development of adipose tissue, was a
sub-magistrate. At Hospet, many had bushy mutton-chop whiskers. Their
garments consisted of a tight fitting pair of short drawers, white
turban, and black kambli (blanket), which does duty as overcoat,
umbrella, and sack for bringing in grass from the outlying country.</p>
<p>Some of the Kurubas are petty land-owners, and raise crops of cholam
(<i>Andropogon Sorghum</i>), rice, <i>Hibiscus cannabinus</i>, etc.
Others are owners of sheep, shepherds, weavers, cultivators, and
stone-masons. The manufacture of coarse blankets for wearing apparel
is, to a very large extent, carried on by the Kurubas. In connection
with this industry, I may quote the following extracts from my
&ldquo;Monograph on the woollen fabric industry of the Madras
Presidency&rdquo; (1898). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Bellary.</i>&mdash;In the Bellary Manual (1872), it is stated
that &ldquo;cumblies are the great article of export, and the rugs made
in the K&#363;dligi t&#257;luk are in great demand, and are sent to all
parts of the country. They are manufactured of various qualities, from
the coarse elastic cumbly used in packing raw cotton, price about six
annas, to a fine kind of blanket, price Rs. 6 to 8. In former times, a
much finer fabric was manufactured from the wool of the lamb when six
months old, and cumblies of this kind sold for Rs. 50 or Rs. 60. These
are no longer made.&rdquo; Coarse blankets are at present made in 193
villages, the weavers being mostly Kurubas, who obtain the wool
locally, sun-dry it, and spin it into thread, which is treated with a
watery paste of tamarind seeds. The weaving is carried out as in the
case of an ordinary cotton cloth, the shuttle being a piece of wood
hollowed out on one side. Inside the ruined Mar&#257;tha fort at
Sand&#363;r dwells a colony of Kurubas, whose profession is
blanket-weaving. The preliminary operations are performed by the women,
and the weaving is carried out by the men, who sit, each in his own
pit, while they pass the shuttle through the warp with repeated
applications of tamarind paste from a pot at their side.</p>
<p><i>Kurnool.</i>&mdash;Blankets are manufactured in 39 villages.
Sheep&rsquo;s wool is beaten and cleaned, and spun into yarn with hand
spindles. In the case of the mutaka, or coarse cumblies used by the
poorer classes, the thread used for the warp is well rubbed with a
gruel made of tamarind seeds before being fitted up in the loom, which
is generally in the open air. In the case of jadi, or cumblies of
superior quality used as carpets, no gruel is used before weaving. But,
when they are taken off the loom, the weavers spread them out tight on
a country cot, pour boiling water over them, and rub them well
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>with their hands, until the texture becomes
thick and smooth.</p>
<p><i>Kistna.</i>&mdash;Both carpets and blankets are made at
Masulipatam, and blankets only, to a considerable extent, in the
Gudiv&#257;da t&#257;luk. The Tahsildar of Nuzv&#299;d, in several
villages of which t&#257;luk the blanket-weaving industry is carried
on, gives me the following note. The sheep, of which it is intended to
shear the wool, are first bathed before shearing. If the wool is not
all of the same colour, the several colours are picked out, and piled
up separately. This being done, each separate pile is beaten, not as a
whole, but bit by bit, with a light stick of finger thickness. Then the
cleaning process is carried out, almost in the way adopted by
cotton-spinners, but with a smaller bow. Then the wool is spun into
yarn with the help of a thin short piece of stick, near the bottom of
which a small flat, circular or square weight of wood or pot-stone
(steatite) is attached, so as to match the force of the whirling given
to the stick on the man&rsquo;s thigh. After a quantity of yarn has
been prepared, a paste is smeared over it, to stiffen it, so that it
can be easily passed through the loom. The paste is prepared with
kajagaddalu, or tamarind seeds, when the former is not available.
Kajagaddalu is a weed with a bulbous root, sometimes as large as a
water-melon. The root is boiled in water, and the thin coating which
covers it removed while it is still hot. The root is then reduced to a
pulp by beating in a mortar with frequent sprinkling of water. The pulp
is mixed with water, to make it sticky, and applied to the yarn.
Tamarind seeds are split in two, and soaked in water for several hours.
The outer coating then becomes detached, and is removed. The seeds are
beaten into a fine flour, and boiled until this acquires <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>the
necessary consistency. They are then made into a paste with water, and
applied to the yarn.</p>
<p><i>Madura.</i>&mdash;Coarse blankets are manufactured to a small
extent by Kuruba women in twenty-two villages of the M&#275;l&#363;r,
Dindigul, and Palni t&#257;luks.</p>
<p>In the province of Mysore, parts of Chitaldr&#363;g and the town of
Kolar are noted for the manufacture of a superior kind of blanket, of
fine texture like homespun, by Kurubas. The wool is spun by the
women.</p>
<p>By one section of the Kurubas, called Sunnata or Vasa (new) only
white blankets are said to be made.</p>
<p>The personal names of Kurubas are derived from their gods, Basappa,
Lingappa, Narasimha, Huliga, etc., with Ayya, Appa, or Anna as affixes.
An educational officer tells me that, when conducting a primary
examination, he came across a boy named Mondrolappa after Sir Thomas
Munro, who still lives in the affections of the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2159src" href="#xd21e2159" name="xd21e2159src">48</a> &ldquo;been
suggested that the name Kuruba is a derivative of the Canarese root
kuru, sheep (<i>cf.</i> Tamil kori); but it has been objected to this
that the Kurumbas were not originally a purely shepherd tribe, and it
is contended that the particular kind of sheep called kori is so called
because it is the sheep of the Kurumbas. Again, the ancient
lexicographer of the Tamil language, Pingala Muni, defines Kurumban as
Kurunila Mannar, or petty chieftains. But the most common derivation is
from the Tamil kurumbu, wickedness, so that Kurumban means a wicked
man. With this may be compared the derivation of Kallan from kalavu,
theft, and the Kallans are now generally believed to have been closely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>connected with, if not identical with the
original Kurumbas. On the other hand, the true derivation may be in the
other direction, as in the case of the Sclavs. The language of the
Kurumbas is a dialect of Canarese, and not of Tamil, as stated by
Bishop Caldwell. It resembles the old Canarese.&rdquo; Concerning the
affinities of the Kurubas, Mr. Stuart states that &ldquo;they are the
modern representatives of the ancient Pallavas, who were once so
powerful in Southern India. In the seventh century, the power of the
Pallava kings seems to have been at its zenith, though very little
trace of their greatness now remains; but, soon after this, the Kongu,
Ch&#333;la, and Ch&#257;lukya chiefs succeeded in winning several
victories over them, and the final overthrow of the Kurumba sovereignty
was effected by the Ch&#333;la King Adondai about the eighth century
A.D., and the Kurumbas were scattered far and wide. Many fled to the
hills, and, in the N&#299;lgiris and Wyn&#257;d, in Coorg and Mysore,
representatives of this ancient race are now found as wild and
uncivilised tribes.&rdquo; Let me call anthropometric evidence, and
compare the Kurubas of Mysore and Bellary with the jungle Kurumbas of
the N&#299;lgiris and the allied K&#257;dirs and Mala V&#275;dars, by
means of the two important physical characters, stature and nasal
index.</p>

<p>In this table, the wide gap which separates the domesticated Kurubas
of the Mysore Province and the adjacent Bellary district from the
conspicuously platyrhine and short-statured Kurumbas and other jungle
tribes, stands out prominently before any one who is accustomed to deal
on a large scale with bodies and noses. And I confess that I like to
regard the Kurumbas, Mala V&#275;dars, K&#257;dirs, Paniyans, and other
allied tribes of short stature with broad noses as the most archaic
existing inhabitants of the south of the Indian peninsula, and as
having dwelt in the jungles, unclothed, and living on roots, long
before the seventh century. The question of the connection between
Kurubas and Kurumbas is further discussed in the note on the latter
tribe.</p>
<p>The popular tradition as to the origin of the caste is as follows.
Originally the Kurubas were K&#257;pus. Their ancestors were Masi Reddi
and N&#299;lamma, who lived on the eastern gh&#257;ts by selling
firewood, and had six sons. Taking pity on their poverty, Siva came
begging to their house in the disguise of a Jangam, and gave
N&#299;lamma some sacred ashes, while promising prosperity through the
birth of another son, who was called Undala Padmanna. The family became
prosperous through agriculture. But, unlike his six brothers, Undala
Padmanna never went out to work in the fields. They accordingly
contrived to get rid of him by asking him to set fire to some brushwood
concealing a white-ant hill, in the hope that the snake within it would
kill him. But, instead of a snake, an innumerable host of sheep
appeared. Frightened at the sight of these strange black beasts, Undala
Padmanna took to his heels. But Siva appeared, and told him that they
were created for his livelihood, and that he should rear them,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>and live by their milk. He taught him how to
milk the sheep and boil the milk, and sent him to a distant town, which
was occupied by R&#257;kshasas, to fetch fire. There the giants were
keeping in bondage a Br&#257;hman girl, who fell in love with Undala
Padmanna. They managed to escape from the clutches of the
R&#257;kshasas by arranging their beds over deep pits, which were dug
for their destruction. To save her lover, the girl transformed him into
a lizard. She then went with him to the place where his flock was, and
Undala Padmanna married a girl of his own caste, and had male offspring
by her as well as the Br&#257;hman. At the marriage of these sons, a
thread kankanam (bracelet) was tied to the wrist of the caste
woman&rsquo;s offspring, and a woollen kankanam to that of the
Br&#257;hman girl&rsquo;s sons. The sons of the former were, therefore,
called Atti (cotton) Kankanadavaru, and those of the latter Unni
(woollen) Kankanadavaru. The latter are considered inferior, as they
are of hybrid origin. A third sub-division is that of the And&#275;
Kurubas, named after the small vessel (and&#275;) used in milking
goats. In a note on the Kurubas of &#256;l&#363;r, Thikka, meaning a
simpleton, is given as the name of an important division. It is noted
in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, that the Kurubas have not taken
kindly to education, and are by nature so simple that Kuruba has, in
some places, become a byword for a simpleton. The Kurubas are also
known as H&#257;lu Mata, or milk caste, as they believe that they were
created out of milk by R&#275;vana Sidd&#275;swara. In Hindustani they
are called Dhangars, or rich people. Some, in spite of their poor dress
and appearance, are well-to-do. At the Madras census, 1901,
K&#257;v&#257;diga, Kumpani, and R&#257;yarvamsam (R&#257;ja&rsquo;s
clan) were returned by some members of the community. In Mysore, the
Kurubas are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2283src" href=
"#xd21e2283" name="xd21e2283src">49</a> to be divided into Hand&#275;
Kurubas and Kurubas proper, who have no intercourse with one another.
The latter worship Bire D&#275;varu, and are Saivites. According to
another account, the H&#257;lu Kurubas of Mysore have sub-divisions
according to the day of the week, on which they offer p&#363;ja to
their god, <i>e.g.</i>, Aditya V&#257;rada (Sunday), Brihaspati
V&#257;rada (Thursday), S&#333;ma V&#257;rada (Monday).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kurubas,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes, &ldquo;are again
sub-divided into clans or gumpus, each having a headman or guru called
a gaudu, who gives his name to the clan. And the clans are again
sub-divided into g&#333;tras or septs, which are mostly of totemistic
origin, and retain their totemistic character to this day. The Arisana
g&#333;tram is particularly worthy of notice. The name means saffron
(turmeric), and this was originally taboo; but, as this caused
inconvenience, the korra grain has been substituted, although the old
name of the sept was retained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The titles of members of the caste are Gauda or Heggade, and the
more prosperous go by the name of Kaudikiaru, a corruption of
Gaudikiaru. Many, at the present day, have adopted the title
N&#257;yakkan. Some are called Gorava V&#257;ndlu.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Stuart, &ldquo;each community of Kurubas, residing
in a group of villages, has a headman or Gaudu. He acts the part of
p&#363;jari or priest in all their ceremonies, presides over their
tribal meetings, and settles disputes. He is paid four annas, or, as
they call it, one r&#363;ka per house per annum. He is a strict
vegetarian, and will not eat with other Kurubas.&rdquo; The headman or
guru of the caste in Bellary goes by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>name of R&#275;vana
Sidd&#275;swara, and he wears the lingam, and follows the Ling&#257;yat
creed. Sometimes he dines with his people, and, on these occasions, new
cooking pots must be used. He exercises the power of inflicting fines,
excommunicating those who have had illicit intercourse with B&#333;yas,
Muhammadans, and others, etc. The Kurubas in Bellary and Anantap&#363;r
are said to pay three pies to their guru for every blanket which they
sell. The name of the tribal headman at &#256;lur is
Kattaiyintiv&#257;du, <i>i.e.</i>, shed with a pial or raised verandah
in front of it. Among both Kurubas and B&#275;dars, a special building,
built by public subscription, and called the katta-illu or
ch&#257;vadi, is set apart for council meetings, at which tribal
affairs are discussed and decided.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches puberty, she is kept in a corner of the house
for eight days. On the ninth day she bathes, and food is taken to her
by an old woman of the house. Kuruba women are invited to be present in
the evening. The girl, covered with a blanket, is seated on a raised
place. Those assembled throw rice over her feet, knees, shoulders, and
head, and into her lap. Coloured turmeric and lime water is then waved
three or five times round her, and r&#257;vikes (body-cloths) are
presented to her.</p>
<p>The following account of the marriage ceremonial was recorded in
Western Bellary. When a marriage has been settled between the parents
of the young people, visits are exchanged by the two families. On a
fixed day, the contracting couple sit on a blanket at the bride&rsquo;s
house, and five women throw rice over five parts of the body as at the
menstrual ceremony. Betel leaves and areca-nuts are placed before them,
of which the first portion is set apart for the god B&#299;rappa, the
second for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>the Gauda, another for the house god, and so on
up to the tenth. A general distribution then takes place The ceremony,
which is called s&#257;kshi vilya or witness betel-leaf, is brought to
a conclusion by waving in front of the couple a brass vessel, over the
mouth of which five betel leaves and a ball of ashes are placed. They
then prostrate themselves before the guru. For the marriage ceremony,
the services of the guru, a Jangam, or a Br&#257;hman priest, are
called into requisition. Early on the wedding morning, the bridal
couple are anointed and washed. A space, called the ir&#257;ni square,
is marked out by placing at the four corners a pot filled with water.
Round each pot a cotton thread is wound five times. Similar thread is
also tied to the milk-post of the marriage pandal (booth), which is
made of p&#299;pal (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) wood. Within the square a
pestle, painted with red and white stripes, is placed, on which the
bride and bridegroom, with two young girls, seat themselves. Rice is
thrown over them, and they are anointed and washed. To each a new cloth
is given, in which they dress themselves, and the wrist-thread
(kankanam) is tied on all four. Presents are given by relations, and
&#257;rathi (red water) is waved round them. The bridegroom is
decorated with a b&#257;shingam (chaplet of flowers), and taken on a
bull to a Hanum&#257;n shrine along with his best man. Cocoanuts,
camphor, and betel are given to the priest as an offering to the god.
According to another account, both bride and bridegroom go to the
shrine, where a matron ties on their foreheads chaplets of flowers,
pearls, etc. At the marriage house a dais has been erected close to the
milk-post, and covered with a blanket, on which a mill-stone and basket
filled with cholum (<i>Andropogon Sorghum</i>) are placed. The
bridegroom, standing with a foot on the stone and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>the
bride with a foot on the basket, the gold t&#257;li, after it has been
touched by five married women, is tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck by
the officiating priest, while those assembled throw rice over the happy
pair, and bless them. According to another version, a bed-sheet is
interposed as a screen, so that the bride and bridegroom cannot see
each other. On the three following days, the newly-married couple sit
on the blanket, and rice is thrown over them. In Western Bellary, the
bridegroom, on the third day, carries the bride on his waist to
Hanum&#257;n temple, where married women throw rice over them. On the
fifth morning, they are once more anointed and washed within the
ir&#257;ni square, and, towards evening, the bride&rsquo;s father hands
her over to her husband, saying &ldquo;She was till this time a member
of my sept and house. Now I hand her over to your sept and
house.&rdquo; On the night of the sixth day, a ceremony called booma
idothu (food placing) is performed. A large metal vessel
(gang&#257;lam) is filled with rice, gh&#299; (clarified butter),
curds, and sugar. Round this some of the relations of the bride and
bridegroom sit, and finish off the food. The number of those, who
partake thereof must be an odd one, and they must eat the food as
quickly as possible. If anything goes wrong with them, while eating or
afterwards, it is regarded as an omen of impending misfortune. Some
even consider it as an indication of the bad character of the
bride.</p>
<p>Concerning the marriage ceremony of the Kurubas of North Arcot, Mr.
Stuart writes as follows. &ldquo;As a preliminary to the marriage, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s father observes certain marks or curls on the head
of the proposed bride. Some of these are believed to forebode
prosperity, and others only misery to the family, into which the girl
enters. They are, therefore, very cautious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>in
selecting only such girls as possess curls (suli) of good fortune. This
curious custom, obtaining among this primitive tribe, is observed by
others only in the case of the purchase of cows, bulls, and horses. One
of the good curls is the b&#257;shingam found on the forehead; and the
bad ones are the p&#275;yan&#257;kallu at the back of the head, and the
edirsuli near the right temple. But widowers seeking for wives are not
generally particular in this respect. [As bad curls are supposed to
cause the death of the man who is their possessor, she is, I am
informed, married to a widower.] The marriage is celebrated in the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and, if the bride belongs to a different
village, she is escorted to that of the bridegroom, and is made to wait
in a particular spot outside it, selected for the occasion. On the
first day of the marriage, p&#363;rna kumbam, a small decorated vessel
containing milk or gh&#299;, with a two-anna piece and a cocoanut
placed on the betel leaf spread over the mouth of it, is taken by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s relations to meet the bride&rsquo;s party. Therethe
distribution of p&#257;n sup&#257;ri takes place, and both parties
return to the village. Meanwhile, the marriage booth is erected, and
twelve twigs of n&#257;val (<i>Eugenia Jambolana</i>) are tied to the
twelve pillars, the central or milk post, under which the bridal pair
sit, being smeared with turmeric, and a yellow thread being tied
thereto. At an auspicious hour of the third day, the couple are made to
sit in the booth, the bridegroom facing the east, and the bride facing
west. On a blanket spread near the kumbam, 2&frac12; measures of rice,
a t&#257;li or bottu, one cocoanut, betel leaf and camphor are placed.
The Gaudu places a ball of vibh&#363;ti (sacred ashes) thereon, breaks
a cocoanut, and worships the kumbam, while camphor is burnt. The Gaudu
next takes the t&#257;li, blesses it, and gives it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>to
the bridegroom, who ties it round the bride&rsquo;s neck. The Gaudu
then, throwing rice on the heads of the pair, recites a song, in which
the names of various people are mentioned, and concluding &lsquo;Oh!
happy girl; Oh! prosperous girl; Basava has come; remove your
veil.&rsquo; The girl then removes her veil, and the men and women
assembled throw rice on the heads of the bridal pair. The ends of their
garments are then tied together, and two girls and three boys are made
to eat out of the plates placed before the married couple. A feast to
all their relations completes the ceremony. The Gaudu receives
2&frac12; measures of rice, five handfuls of nuts and betel leaf, and
twelve saffrons (pieces of turmeric) as his fee. Even though the girl
has attained puberty, the nuptial ceremony is not coincident with the
wedding, but is celebrated a few months later.&rdquo; In like manner,
among the Kammas, Gangimakkulu, and other classes, consummation does
not take place until three months after the marriage ceremony, as it is
considered unlucky to have three heads of a family in a household
during the first year of marriage. By the delay, the birth of a child
should take place only in the second year, so that, during the first
year, there will be only two heads, husband and wife. At a marriage
among the Kurubas of the Madura district, a chicken is waved in front
of the contracting couple, to avert the evil eye. The maternal
uncle&rsquo;s consent to a marriage is necessary, and, at the wedding,
he leads the bride to the pandal. A Kuruba may, I am informed, marry
two sisters, either on the death of one of them, or if his first wife
has no issue, or suffers from an incurable disease. Some twenty years
ago, when an unmarried Kuruba girl was taken to a temple, to be
initiated as a Basavi (dedicated prostitute), the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>caste men prosecuted the father as a protest
against the practice.</p>
<p>In the North Arcot district, according to Mr. Stuart, &ldquo;the
mother and child remain in a separate hut for the first ten days after
delivery. On the eleventh day, all the Kuruba females of the village
bring each a pot of hot water, and bathe the mother and child. Betel
and nuts are distributed, and all the people of the village eat in the
mother&rsquo;s house. On the next market-day, her husband, with some of
his male friends, goes to a neighbouring market, and consults with a
Korava or Yerukala what name is to be given to the child, and the name
he mentions is then given to it.&rdquo; In a case which came before the
police in the Bellary district in 1907, a woman complained that her
infant child had been taken away, and concealed in the house of another
woman, who was pregnant. The explanation of the abduction was that
there is a belief that, if a pregnant woman keeps a baby in her bed,
she will have no difficulty at the time of delivery.</p>
<p>Remarriage of widows is permitted. The ceremony is performed in a
temple or dark room, and the t&#257;li is tied by a widow, a woman
dedicated to the deity, or a D&#257;sayya (mendicant) of their own
caste. According to another account, a widow is not allowed to wear a
t&#257;li, but is presented with a cloth. Hence widow marriage is
called Sir&#275; Udiki. Children of widows are married into families in
which no widow remarriage has taken place, and are treated like
ordinary members of the community.</p>
<p>In Western Bellary I gathered that the dead are buried, those who
have been married with the face upwards, others with the face
downwards. The grave is dug north and south, and the head is placed to
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>south. Earth is thrown into the grave by
relations before it is filled in. A mound is raised over it, and three
stones are set up, over the head, navel, and feet. The eldest son of
the deceased places on his left shoulder a pot filled with water, in
the bottom of which three small holes are made, through which the water
escapes. Proceeding from the spot beneath which the head rests, he
walks round the grave, and then drops the pot so that it falls on the
mound, and goes home without looking back. This ceremony is a very
important one with both Kurubas and B&#275;dars. In the absence of a
direct heir, he who carries the pot claims the property of the
deceased, and is considered to be the inheritor thereof. For the
propitiation of ancestors, cooked rice and sweetmeats, with a new
turban and cloth or petticoat, according to the sex of the deceased,
are offered up. Ancestors who died childless, unless they left
property, do not receive homage. It is noted, in the Bellary Gazetteer,
that &ldquo;an unusual rite is in some cases observed after deaths, a
pot of water being worshipped in the house on the eleventh day after
the funeral, and taken the next morning and emptied in some lonely
place. The ceremony is named the calling back of the dead, but its real
significance is not clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the death ceremonies in the North Arcot district, Mr. Stuart
writes that &ldquo;the son, or, in his absence, a near relative goes
round the grave three times, carrying a pot of water, in which he makes
a hole at each round. On the third round he throws down the pot, and
returns home straight, without turning his face towards the direction
of the grave. For three days, the four carriers of the bier are not
admitted into their houses, but they are fed at the cost of the
deceased&rsquo;s heir. On the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"
href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>the third day, cooked rice, a
fowl and water are taken to the burial-ground, and placed near the
grave, to be eaten by the spirit of the dead. The son, and all his
relations, return home, beating on their mouths. Pollution is observed
for ten days, and, on the eleventh day, sheep and fowls are killed, and
a grand feast is given to the Kurumbas of the village. Before the feast
commences, a leaf containing food is placed in a corner of the house,
and worshipped. This is removed on the next morning, and placed over
the roof, to be eaten by crows. If the deceased be a male, the glass
bangles worn by his wife on her right arm are broken on the same
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patron saint of the Kurubas is B&#299;rappa or
B&#299;rad&#275;varu, and they will not ride on horses or ponies, as
these are the vehicles of the god. But they worship, in addition,
various minor deities, <i>e.g.</i>, Uligamma, Mallappa, Anthargattamma,
Kenchar&#257;ya, and have their house gods, who are worshipped either
by a house or by an entire exogamous sept. In some places,
M&#257;riamma and Sunkulamma are worshipped on Tuesday and Friday, and
the sheep and other offerings are the perquisite of B&#333;yas,
M&#257;las, and M&#257;digas. Some families of Kuruba D&#257;saris
reverence a goddess called Homb&#257;lamma, who is worshipped secretly
by a p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) at dead of night. Everything used in
connection with the rite is buried or otherwise disposed of before
morning. The Kurubas show reverence for the jammi tree (<i>Prosopis
spicigera</i>) and ashwatham (<i>Ficus religiosa</i>) by not cutting
them. It was noticed by Mr. F. Fawcett that, at the temples of the
village goddesses Wannathamma and Durgamma in the Bellary district, an
old Kuruba woman performs the daily worship. In the mantapam of the
temple at L&#275;p&#257;kshi, in the Anantapur district, &ldquo;is the
sculptured figure of a man leaning his chin upon his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>hands, which is said to represent a Kuruba who
once acted as mediator between the builder of the temple and his
workmen in a dispute about wages. The image is still bathed in oil, and
worshipped by the local Kurubas, who are proud of the important part
played by their caste-man.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2523src"
href="#xd21e2523" name="xd21e2523src">50</a> In Mysore, the Kurubas are
said to worship a box, which they believe contains the wearing apparel
of Krishna under the name of Junjappa. One of the goddesses worshipped
by the Kurubas is named K&#275;lu D&#275;varu or Man&#275; Hennu
D&#275;varu, the pot or household deity. She is worshipped annually at
the Dasara festival, and, on occasions of marriage, just before the
t&#257;li is tied. The pot is made by a Kumb&#257;ra (potter), who is
well paid for his work. During its manufacture, he has to take only one
meal daily, and to avoid pollution of all kinds. The clay should be
kneaded with the hands, and wetted with milk, milk of tender cocoanuts,
and water. When at work on it, the potter should close his mouth with a
bandage, so that his breath may not defile the pot. The Kurubas who are
settled in the Madura district reverence V&#299;ra Lakkamma (Lakshmi)
as their family deity, and an interesting feature in connection with
the worship of their goddess is that cocoanuts are broken on the head
of a special Kuruba, who becomes possessed by the deity.</p>
<p>The Kurubas are ancestor worshippers, and many of them have in their
possession golden discs called hith&#257;radha t&#257;li, with the
figures of one or more human beings stamped on them. The discs are made
by Akas&#257;les (goldsmiths), who stamp them from steel dies. They are
either kept in the house, or worn round the neck by women. If the
deceased was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>celebrity in the community, a large plate is
substituted for a disc.</p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the Kurubas, Mr. Francis writes as
follows. &ldquo;The most striking point about the caste is its strong
leaning towards the Ling&#257;yat faith. Almost everywhere, Jangams are
called in as priests, and allegiance to the Ling&#257;yat maths
(religious institutions) is acknowledged, and in places
(K&#257;mal&#257;puram for example), the ceremonies at weddings and
funerals have been greatly modified in the direction of the
Ling&#257;yat pattern.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2532src" href=
"#xd21e2532" name="xd21e2532src">51</a> &ldquo;In the North Arcot
district, the Gaudu is entrusted with the custody of a golden image
representing the hero of the clan, and keeps it carefully in a small
box filled with turmeric powder. There are also some images set up in
temples built for the purpose. Once a year, several neighbouring clans
assemble at one of their bigger temples, which is lighted with
gh&#299;, and, placing their images in a row, offer to them flowers,
cocoanuts, milk, etc., but they do not slay any victim. On the last day
of their festival, the Kurumbas take a bath, worship a bull, and break
cocoanuts upon the heads of p&#363;j&#257;ris who have an hereditary
right to this distinction, and upon the head of the sacred bull. Some
Kurumbas do not adopt this apparently inhuman practice. A
p&#363;j&#257;ri or priest, supposed to have some supernatural power,
officiates, and begins by breaking a few nuts on the heads of those
nearest to him, and then the rest go on, the fragments belonging by
right to those whose skulls have cracked them, and who value the pieces
as sacred morsels of food. For a month before this ceremony, all the
people have taken no meat, and for three days the p&#363;j&#257;ris
have lived on fruits and milk alone. At <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>the feast, therefore,
all indulge in rather immoderate eating, but drink no liquor, calling
excitedly upon their particular god to grant them a prosperous year.
The temples of this caste are usually rather extensive, but rude, low
structures, resembling an enclosed mantapam supported upon rough stone
pillars, with a small inner shrine, where the idols are placed during
festival time. A wall of stone encloses a considerable space round the
temple, and this is covered with small structures formed of four flat
stones, three being the walls, and the fourth the roof. The stone
facing the open side has a figure sculptured upon it, representing the
deceased Gaudu, or p&#363;j&#257;ri, to whom it is dedicated. For each
person of rank one of these monuments is constructed, and here
periodically, and always during the annual feasts, p&#363;ja is made
not only to the spirits of the deceased chiefs, but also to those of
all who have died in the clan. It seems impossible not to connect this
with those strange structures called by the natives
P&#257;ndava&rsquo;s temples. They are numerous where the Kurumbas are
now found, and are known to have been raised over the dead. Though the
Kurumbas bury, they do not now raise their monuments over the resting
place of the corpse. Nor can they build them upon anything approaching
to the gigantic scale of the ancient kistvaen or
dolmen.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2537src" href="#xd21e2537"
name="xd21e2537src">52</a> It was noted by a correspondent of the
Indian Antiquary<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2540src" href="#xd21e2540"
name="xd21e2540src">53</a> that, in the Kaladgi &lsquo;district,&rsquo;
he &ldquo;came across the tomb of a Kuruba only four years old. It was
a complete miniature dolmen about eighteen inches every way, composed
of four stones, one at each side, one at the rear, and a cap-stone. The
interior was occupied by two round stones about the size of a
man&rsquo;s fist, painted red, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>the deceased resting in his
mother earth below.&rdquo; In the open country near Kad&#363;r in
Mysore, is a shrine of B&#299;rad&#275;varu, which consists of four
stone pillars several feet in height surmounted by flat slabs as a
cap-stone, within which the deity is represented by round stones, and
stones with snakes carved on them are deposited. Within the Kuruba
quarter of the town, the shrine of Anthargattamma is a regular dolmen
beneath a margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) tree, in
which the goddess is represented by rounded stones imbedded in a mound
of earth. Just outside the same town, close to a p&#299;pal tree
(<i lang="la-x-bio">Ficus religiosa</i>) are two smaller dolmen-like
structures containing stones representing two Kuruba D&#257;saris, one
a centenarian, who are buried there.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;The village of Maliar, in the Hadagalli t&#257;luk of the
Bellary district, contains a Siva temple, which is famous throughout
the district for an annual festival held there in the month of
February. This festival has now dwindled more or less into a cattle
fair. But the fame of the temple continues as regards the
k&#257;ranika, which is a cryptic sentence uttered by a priest,
containing a prophecy of the prospect of the agricultural season of the
ensuing year. The p&#363;j&#257;ri of the temple is a Kuruba. The feast
in the temple lasts for ten days. On the last day of the feast, the god
Siva is represented as returning victorious from the battlefield after
having slain Malla with a huge bow. He is met half-way from the field
of battle by the goddess. The huge wooden bow is brought, and placed on
end before the god. The Kuruba priest climbs up the bow as it is held
up by two assistants, and then gets on the shoulders of these men. In
this posture he stands rapt in silence for a few minutes, looking in
several directions. He then begins to quake and quiver from head to
foot. This is the sign of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>spirit of the Siva god
possessing him&mdash;the sign of the divine afflatus upon him. A solemn
silence holds the assembly, for the time of the k&#257;ranika has
approached. The shivering Kuruba utters a cryptic sentence, such as
&#256;k&#257;sakk&#275; sidlu bodiyuttu, or thunder struck the sky.
This is at once copied down, and interpreted as a prophecy that there
will be much rain in the year to come. Thus every year, in the month of
February, the k&#257;ranika of Mailar is uttered and copied, and kept
by all in the district as a prophecy. This k&#257;ranika
prognostication is also pronounced now at the Mallari temple in the
Dharwar district, at Nerakini in the &#256;l&#363;r t&#257;luk, and at
Mailar Lingappa in the Harapanahalli t&#257;luk.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>The rule of inheritance among the Kurubas is said<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2571src" href="#xd21e2571" name="xd21e2571src">55</a> to
differ very little from that current among Hindus, but the daughters,
if the deceased has no son, share equally with the agnates. They belong
to the right-hand faction, and have the privilege of passing through
the main baz&#257;rs in processions. Some Mudalis and
&lsquo;Naidus&rsquo; are said to have no objection to eat, drink, and
smoke with Kurubas. Gollas and some inferior flesh-eating K&#257;pus
will also do so.</p>

Kurubas (shepherds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>and weavers) who live in the plains and
open country, I may quote the evidence of various witnesses:&mdash;</p>
<p>Madras Census Report, 1891.&mdash;&ldquo;The Kurumbas or Kurrubas
are the modern representatives of the ancient Kurumbas or Pallavas, who
were once so powerful throughout Southern India, but very little trace
of their greatness now remains. In the seventh century, the power of
the Pallava kings seems to have been at its zenith; but, shortly after
this, the Kongu, Ch&#333;la, and Ch&#257;l&#363;kya chiefs succeeded in
winning several victories over them. The final overthrow of the Kurumba
sovereignty was effected by the Ch&#333;la king Adondai about the
seventh or eighth century A.D., and the Kurumbas were scattered far and
wide. Many fled to the hills, and in the N&#299;lgiris and the
Wyn&#257;d, in Coorg and Mysore, representatives of this ancient race
are now found as wild and uncivilised tribes. Elsewhere the Kurumbas
are more advanced, and are usually shepherds, and weavers of coarse
woollen blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Kuruman.</i>&mdash;This caste is found in the
N&#299;lgiris and the Wyn&#257;d, with a slight sprinkling in the
Nilamb&#363;r and Attap&#257;di hills in Malabar. Their principal
occupations are wood-cutting, and the collection of forest produce. The
name is merely another form of Kurumban, but, as they differ from the
ordinary Kurumbas, it seemed better to show them separately. I think,
however, that they were originally identical with the shepherd
Kurumbans, and their present separation is merely the result of their
isolation in the fastnesses of the Western Gh&#257;ts, to which their
ancestors fled, or gradually retreated after the downfall of the
Kurumba dynasty. The name Kurumbran&#257;d, a sub-division of Malabar,
still bears testimony to their once powerful position.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span></p>
<p>Madras Census Report, 1901&mdash;&rdquo;<i>Kuruba;
Kurumban.</i>&mdash;These two have always been treated as the same
caste. Mr. Thurston (Madras Mus. Bull. II, <span class="sc">i</span>)
thinks they are distinct. I have no new information, which will clearly
decide the matter, but the fact seems to be that Kurumban is the Tamil
form of the Telugu or Canarese Kuruba, and that the two terms are
applied to the same caste according to the language in which it is
referred to. There was no confusion in the abstraction offices between
the two names, and it will be seen that Kuruba is returned where
Canarese and Telugu are spoken, and Kurumban where the vernacular is
Tamil. There are two sharply defined bodies of Kurumbans&mdash;those
who live on the N&#299;lgiri plateau, speak the Kurumba dialect, and
are wild junglemen; and those who live on the plains, speak Canarese,
and are civilised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mysore Census Report, 1891&mdash;<i>K&#257;du Kuruba or
Kurumba.</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The tribal name of Kuruba has been traced to
the primeval occupation of the race, viz., the tending of sheep,
perhaps when pre-historic man rose to the pastoral stage. The Uru or
civilised Kurubas, who are genuine tillers of the soil, and who are
dotted over the country in populous and thriving communities, and many
of whom have, under the present &lsquo;Pax Britannica,&rsquo; further
developed into enterprising tradesmen and withal lettered Government
officials, are the very antipodes of the K&#257;du or wild Kurubas or
Kurumbas. The latter, like the Irulig&#257;s and S&#333;lig&#257;s, are
the denizens of the backwoods of the country, and have been correctly
classed under the aboriginal population. The Tamilised name of Kurumba
is applied to certain clans dwelling on the heights of the
N&#299;lgiris, who are doubtless the offshoots of the aboriginal
K&#257;du Kuruba stock found in Mysore.&rdquo; <span class=

<p>W. R. King. Aboriginal Tribes of the Nilgiri
Hills&mdash;&rdquo;<i>Kurumbas.</i>&mdash;This tribe is of another race
from the shepherd Kurumbas. The N&#299;lgiri tribe have neither cattle
nor sheep, and in language, dress, and customs, have no affinity
whatever with their namesakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>G. Oppert. Original Inhabitants of India&mdash;&rdquo;<i>Kurubas or
Kurumbas.</i>&mdash;However separated from each other, and scattered
among the Dravidian clans with whom they have dwelt, and however
distant from one another they still live, there is hardly a province in
the whole of Bharatavarasha which cannot produce, if not some living
remnants of this race, at least some remains of past times which prove
their presence. Indeed, the Kurumbas must be regarded as very old
inhabitants of this land, who can contest with their Dravidian kinsmen
the priority of occupation of the Indian soil. The terms Kuruba and
Kurumba are originally identical, though the one form is, in different
places, employed for the other, and has thus occasionally assumed a
special local meaning. Mr. H. B. Grigg appears to contradict himself
when, while speaking of the Kurumbas, he says that &lsquo;in the low
country they are called Kurubas or C&#363;rub&#257;ru, and are divided
into such families as &#256;n&#275; or elephant, N&#257;ya or dog,
M&#257;le or hill Kurumbas.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2632src"
href="#xd21e2632" name="xd21e2632src">56</a> Such a distinction between
mountain Kurumbas and plain Kurumbas cannot be established. The Rev. G.
Richter will find it difficult to prove that the Kurubas of Mysore are
only called so as shepherds, and that no connection exists between
these Kurubas and the Kurumbas. Mr. Lewis Rice calls the wild tribes as
well as the shepherds Kurubas, but seems to overlook the fact that both
terms are identical, and refer to only the ethnological
distinction.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"

<p>The above extracts will suffice for the purpose of showing that the
distinction between the jungle Kurumbas and the more civilised Kurubas,
and their relationship towards each other, call for a &lsquo;permanent
settlement.&rsquo; And I may briefly place on record the results of
anthropometric observations on the jungle Kurumbas of the
N&#299;lgiris, and the domesticated Kurubas of Mysore and the Bellary
district, whose stature and nasal index (two factors of primary
importance) are compared with those of the jungle Paniyans of Malabar
and K&#257;dirs of the &#256;naimalai mountains&mdash;</p>

<p>A glance at the above table at once shows that there is a closer
affinity between the three dark-skinned, short, platyrhine jungle
tribes, than between the jungle Kurumbas and the lighter-skinned,
taller, and more leptorhine Kurubas.</p>
<p>The domesticated Kurubas are dealt with separately, and, in the
remarks which follow, I am dealing solely with the jungle Kurumbas.</p>
<p>The K&#257;du, or wild Kurumbas of Mysore are divided into
&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) Betta or hill Kurumbas, with sub-divisions called
&#256;n&#275; (elephant), Bevina (n&#299;m tree: <i>Melia
Azadirachta</i>), and Kolli (fire-brand)&mdash;a small and active race,
capable of great fatigue, who are expert woodmen; (<i>b</i>) J&#275;nu
or honey Kurumbas, said to be a darker and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>inferior race, who employ themselves in
collecting honey and bees-wax.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2722src" href="#xd21e2722" name="xd21e2722src">57</a></p>
<p>For the following note on the K&#257;du Kurumbas I am indebted to
the Mysore Census Report, 1891. &ldquo;There are two clans among them,
viz., Bettada and J&#275;nu. The former worship the forest deities
N&#257;r&#257;li and M&#257;stamma; eat flesh and &ldquo;drink liquor,
a favourite beverage being prepared from r&#257;gi (<i>Eleusine
Coracana</i>) flour. Some of their habits and customs are worth
mentioning, as indicating their plane of civilization. They have two
forms of marriage. One is similar to the elaborate ceremony among the
Vakkaligas, while the other is the simple one of a formal exchange of
betel leaves and areca nuts, which concludes the nuptials. The
K&#257;du Kurubas can only eat meals prepared by members of the higher
castes. During their periodical illnesses, the females live outside the
limits of the H&#257;di (group of rude huts) for three days. And, in
cases of childbirth, none but the wet nurse or other attendant enters
the room of the confined woman for ten days. In cases of sickness, no
medical treatment is resorted to; on the other hand, exorcisms, charms,
incantations, and animal sacrifices are more generally in vogue. The
male&rsquo;s dress consists of either a bit of cloth to cover their
nudity, or a piece of coarse cloth tied round the waist, and reaching
to the knees. They wear ornaments of gold, silver, or brass. They are
their own barbers, and use broken glass for razors. The females wear
coarse cloth four yards long, and have their foreheads tattooed in dots
of two or three horizontal lines, and wear ear-rings, glass bangles,
and necklaces of black beads. Strangers are not allowed to enter their
h&#257;dis or hamlets with shoes or slippers on. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>In
case of death, children are buried, whilst adults are burned. On the
occurrence of any untoward event, the whole site is abandoned, and a
new h&#257;di set up in the vicinity. The K&#257;du Kurubas are very
active, and capable of enduring great fatigue. It is said that they are
revengeful, but, if treated kindly, they will do willing service. The
J&#275;nu Kurubas live in small detached huts in the interior of thick
jungles, far away from inhabited places. Their habits are no less wild.
The male dress consists of either a woollen kambli or coarse cloth, and
a skull cap. The female&rsquo;s s&#257;di is white coarse cloth, their
wonted ornaments being a pair of brass ear-rings, strings of black
beads tied round the neck, and glass bangles on the wrist. These people
do not allow to outcasts and Musalmans access to their premises, or
permit shoes being brought into their houses or streets. They eat
flesh, and take meals from Vakkaligas, Ling&#257;yats, and other
superior castes. They subsist on wild bamboo seed, edible roots, etc.,
found in the jungle, often mixed with honey. They are said not
unfrequently to make a dessert out of bees in preference to milk,
gh&#299; (clarified butter), etc. They are engaged chiefly in felling
timber in the forests, and other similar rude pursuits, but they never
own or cultivate land for themselves, or keep live-stock of their own.
They are very expert in tracking wild animals, and very skilfully elude
accidental pursuits thereby. Their children, more than two years old,
move about freely in the jungle. They are said to be hospitable to
travellers visiting their place at any unusual hour. They are Saivites,
and Jangams are their gurus. The ceremonial pollution on account of
death lasts for ten days, as with the Br&#257;hmans. Children are
buried, while adults, male or female, are cremated. A curious trait of
this primitive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>race is that the unmarried females of the
village or h&#257;di generally sleep in a hut or ch&#257;vadi set apart
for them, whilst the adult bachelors and children have a separate
building, both under the eye of the head tribesman. The hut for the
latter is called pundug&#257;r ch&#257;vadi, meaning literally the
abode of vagabonds.&rdquo; The J&#275;nu Kurumbas are said to eat, and
the Betta Kurumbas to abstain from eating the flesh of the
&lsquo;bison&rsquo; (<i lang="la-x-bio">Bos gaurus</i>).</p>

<p>In a note on the J&#275;nu and Betta Kurumbas of Mysore, Mr. M.
Venkatanarnappa writes as follows. &ldquo;The Betta are better clothed
and fed than the J&#275;n Kurumbas. Their occupation is kumri (burning
and shifting) cultivation. Their women are clever at basket-making.
They can be distinguished by the method of dress which their women have
adopted, and the way in which the men wear their hair. A Betta woman
covers her body below the shoulders by tying a long cloth round the
arm-pits, leaving shoulders and arms bare, whereas a J&#275;n woman in
good circumstances dresses up like the village females, and, if poor,
ties a piece of cloth round her loins, and wears another to partially
conceal the upper part of her body. Among males, a Betta Kurumba leaves
his hair uncut, and gathers it from fore and aft into a knot tied on
the crown of the head. A J&#275;n Kurumba shaves like the ryots,
leaving a tuft behind, or clips or crops it, with a curly or bushy
growth to protect the head from heat and cold. The Betta and J&#275;n
Kurumbas never intermarry.&rdquo; The Betta Kurumbas are, I am told,
excellent elephant mahauts (drivers), and very useful at keddah
(elephant-catching) operations.</p>
<p>Of the K&#257;du and Betta Kurumbas, as they were at the beginning
of the nineteenth century, the following <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>account is given by
Buchanan.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2749src" href="#xd21e2749" name=
"xd21e2749src">58</a> &ldquo;The Cad Curubaru are a rude tribe, who are
exceedingly poor and wretched. In the fields near the villages, they
build miserable low huts, have a few rags only for clothing, and the
hair of both sexes stands out matted like a mop, and swarms with
vermin. Some of them hire themselves out as labouring servants to the
farmers, and receive monthly wages. Others, in crop seasons, watch the
fields at night, to keep off elephants and wild hogs. In the intervals
between crops, they work as daily labourers, or go into the woods, and
collect the roots of wild yams (<i>Dioscorea</i>), part of which they
eat, and part exchange with the farmers for grain. Their manner of
driving away the elephant is by running against him with a burning
torch made of bamboos. The animal sometimes turns, waits till the
Curubaru comes close up; but these poor people, taught by experience,
push boldly on, dash their torches against the elephant&rsquo;s head,
who never fails to take to immediate flight. Should their courage fail,
and should they attempt to run away, the elephant would immediately
pursue, and put them to death. The Curubaru have no means of killing so
large an animal, and, on meeting with one in the day-time, are as much
alarmed as any other of the inhabitants. During the Sultan&rsquo;s
reign they caught a few in pitfalls. [I have heard of a clever Kurumba,
who caught an elephant by growing pumpkins and vegetable marrow, for
which elephants have a partiality, over a pit on the outskirts of his
field.&mdash;E.T.] The wild hogs are driven out of the fields by
slings, but they are too fierce for the Curubaru to kill. These people
frequently suffer from tigers, against which their wretched huts are a
poor defence; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>and, when this wild beast is urged by hunger, he
is regardless of their burning torches. These Curubaru have dogs, with
which they catch deer, antelopes, and hares; and they have the art of
taking in snares, peacocks, and other esculent birds. They believe that
good men, after death, will become benevolent D&#275;vas, and bad men
destructive D&#275;vas. They are of such known honesty that on all
occasions they are entrusted with provisions by the farmers, who are
persuaded that the Curubaru would rather starve than take one grain of
what was given to them in charge. The spirits of the dead are believed
to appear in dreams to their old people, and to direct them to make
offerings to a female deity named Bettada Chicama, that is, the mother
of the hill. Unless these offerings are made, this goddess occasions
sickness. In cases of adultery, the husband flogs his wife severely,
and, if he is able, beats her paramour. If he be not able, he applies
to the gaudo (headman), who does it for him.&rdquo; The Betta Curubaru,
Buchanan continues, &ldquo;live in poor huts near the villages, and the
chief employment of the men is the cutting of timber, and making of
baskets. With a sharp stick they also dig up spots of ground in the
skirts of the forest, and sow them with r&#257;gi (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Eleusine Coracana</i>). The men watch at night the fields of
the farmers, but they are not so dexterous at this as the Cad Curubaru.
In this class, the Cutigas are women that prefer another man to their
husband, or widows, who do not wish to relinquish carnal enjoyment.
Their children are not considered as illegitimate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the casual system of clearing the jungle in vogue among the
Kurumbas, I may quote the following description.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2767src" href="#xd21e2767" name="xd21e2767src">59</a> &ldquo;In
their search for food, this wild tribe <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>naturally prefers a
forest cleared of all undergrowth, in which to move about, and the
ingenuity with which they attain this end, and outwit the vigilant
forest subordinates, is worthy of a better object. I have heard of a
Kurumba walking miles from his h&#257;di or hamlet, with a ball of dry
smouldering elephant dung concealed in his waist-cloth. This he carried
to the heart of the forest reserve, and, selecting a suitable spot, he
placed the smouldering dung, with a plentiful supply of dry inflammable
grass over it, in such a position as to allow the wind to play upon it,
and fan it into a flame with the pleasing certainty that the smoke from
the fire would not be detected by the watchers on the distant
fire-lines until the forest was well alight, the flames beyond all
control, and the Kurumba himself safe at home in his h&#257;di,
awaiting the arrival of the forest subordinate to summon the settlement
to assist in the hopeless task of extinguishing the fire.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>Of the Kurumbas who are found in the Wyn&#257;d, Calicut, and
Ern&#257;d t&#257;luks of Malabar, the following account is given in
the Gazetteer of that district. &ldquo;They are sub-divided into Mullu
(bamboo) Kurumbans, J&#275;n or T&#275;n (honey) Kurumbans, also called
K&#257;du or Sh&#333;la N&#257;yakkans (or J&#275;nu Koyyo Sh&#333;la
N&#257;yakas, <i>i.e.</i>, honey-cutting lords of the woods), and
&#362;rali or B&#275;t Kurumbans; of which the first-named class, who
consider themselves superior to the others, are cultivators and
hunters; the second wood-cutters and collectors of honey; and the third
make baskets and implements of agriculture. The Mullu and T&#275;n
Kurumbans have headmen with titles of M&#363;ppan and Mudali
respectively conferred by their janmis (landlords). The Kurumbans, like
many of the other hill-tribes, use bows and arrows, with which they are
expert. The caste deity of the T&#275;n Kurumbans is called Masti. It
is perhaps worth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166"
name="pb166">166</a>]</span>remarking that the &#362;rali Kurumbans of
the Wynaad differ from the other two classes in having no headmen,
observing a shorter period of pollution after a birth than any other
Malabar tribe and none at all after a death, and in not worshipping any
of the Malabar animistic deities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief sub-divisions of the Kurumbas on the N&#299;lgiris, and in
the Wyn&#257;d, are said, in the Madras Census Report, 1891, to be
&ldquo;Mullu (thorn), Betta or Vetta (hill), &#362;r&#257;li (&#362;r,
a village), T&#275;n (honey), and Tac&rsquo;chan&#257;dan M&#363;ppan
(carpenter headman). Of these, the first and last speak Malay&#257;lam,
and wear a lock in front of their head in the Malabar fashion. The rest
speak Canarese. &#362;r&#257;li Kurumbas work in metals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The villages of the Kurumbas on the N&#299;lgiri hills are, Mr.
Grigg writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2788src" href="#xd21e2788"
name="xd21e2788src">60</a> called mottas. They consist generally of
only four or five huts, made of mud and wattle, with thatched roofs.
The front of the house is sometimes whitewashed, and ornamented with
rude drawings of men and animals in red earth or charcoal. They store
their grain in large oval baskets, and for bottles they use gourds.
They clear a patch round about the village, and sow the ground with
r&#257;gi (<i>Eleusine Coracana</i>), tenne (<i>Setaria italica</i>),
or kiri (<i>Amarantus</i>). They dig up roots (called g&#257;s&#363;)
for food, and collect the jungle produce, honey, resin, gall-nuts,
etc., which they barter with low-country traders, and they are clever
in catching game in nets, and dispose of the flesh in a surprisingly
short time. Kurumbas occasionally take work on coffee plantations, and
some earn a livelihood by officiating as priests to the Badagas. They
are also employed as musicians at wedding feasts and funerals of the
other tribes, where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>they play on clarionets, drums, and
tambourines, as well as the b&#363;guri. They make baskets of rattan
and milk vessels out of a joint of bamboo, as well as nets of a thread
called oilhatti. Their women confine themselves to the limited work of
their households, fetching water, cooking, etc. The following extract
embraces all that can be said of the religion of the Kurumbas.
&ldquo;Some profess to worship Siva, and occasionally women mark their
foreheads with the Siva spot. Others, living near Barliar, worship
Kuribattraya (lord of many sheep) and the wife of Siva under the name
of Musni. They worship also a rough stone under the name of
Hiriad&#275;va, setting it up either in a cave, or in a circle of
stones like the so-called Kurumba k&#333;vil of the Badagas, which the
latter would seem to have borrowed from the Kurumbas. To this they make
p&#363;ja, and offer cooked rice at the sowing time. They also profess
to sacrifice to Hiriad&#275;va a goat, which they kill at their own
houses, after sprinkling water, and eat, giving a portion of flesh to
the p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest). Others say that they have no
p&#363;j&#257;ri: among such a scattered tribe customs probably vary in
each motta&rdquo;&mdash;(Breeks). It is recorded by Dr. Rivers, in
connection with the Toda legendary stories of Kwoten, that &ldquo;one
day Kwoten went with Erten of Keadr, who was spoken of as his servant
to Poni, in the direction of Polkat (Calicut). At Poni there is a
stream called Palpa, the commencement of which may be seen on the
Kundahs. Kwoten and Erten went to drink water out of the stream at a
place where a goddess (teu) named Terkosh had been bathing.... Finally,
they came to Terkosh, who said to Kwoten, &ldquo;Do not come near me, I
am a teu.&rdquo; Kwoten paid no heed to this, but said &ldquo;You are a
beautiful woman,&rdquo; and went and lay with her. Then Terkosh went
away to her hill at Poni, where she is now, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>and
to this day the Kurumbas go there once a year and offer plantains to
her, and light lamps in her honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is further recorded by Dr. Rivers that &ldquo;two ceremonial
objects are obtained by the Todas from the Kurumbas. One is the tall
pole called tadrsi or tadri, which is used in the dance at the second
funeral ceremonies, and afterwards burnt. Poles of the proper length
are said to grow only on the Malabar side of the N&#299;lgiris, and are
probably most easily obtained from the Kurumbas. The other is the
teiks, or funeral post at which the buffalo is killed.&rdquo; Besides
supplying the Badagas with the elephant-pole required at their
funerals, the Kurumbas have to sow the first handful of grain for the
Badagas every season. The ceremony is thus described by
Harkness.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2807src" href="#xd21e2807" name=
"xd21e2807src">61</a> &ldquo;A family of the Burghers (Badagas) had
assembled, which was about to commence ploughing. With them were two or
three Kurumbas, one of whom had set up a stone in the centre of the
spot on which we were standing, and, decorating it with wild flowers,
prostrated himself to it, offered incense, and sacrificed a goat, which
had been brought there by the Burghers. He then took the guidance of
the plough, and, having ploughed some ten or twelve paces, gave it
over, possessed himself of the head of the sacrificed animal, and left
the Burghers to prosecute their labours.... The Kurumba, sowing the
first handful, leaves the Burgher to go on with the remainder, and,
reaping the first sheaf, delivers it with the sickle to him, to
accomplish the remainder of the task. At harvest time, or when the
whole of the grain has been gathered in, the Kurumba receives his dues,
or proportion of the produce.&rdquo; The relations of the Kurumbas with
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>Badagas at the present day, and the share which
the former take in the ceremonies of the latter, are dealt with in the
account of the Badagas.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2814width" id="pl4-169"><img src=
"images/pl4-169.jpg" alt="Kurumba cave." width="542" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Kurumba cave.</p>
</div>
<p>I am informed that, among the Kurumbas of the N&#299;lgiris, it is
the custom for several brothers to take one wife in common
(adelphogamy), and that they do not object to their women being open to
others also. There is said to be no marriage rite. A man and woman will
mate together, and live as husband and wife. And, if it happens that,
in a family, there has been a succession of such wives for one or two
generations, it becomes an event, and is celebrated as such. The pair
sit together, and pour water over each other from pots. They then put
on new cloths, and a feast is partaken of. Among the Sh&#333;la
N&#257;yakkars, a feature of the marriage ceremony is said to be for
the bride to roll a cheroot of tobacco leaves, which both parties must
smoke in turn.</p>
<p>Writing concerning the Irulas and Kurumbas, Mr. Walhouse
says<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2822src" href="#xd21e2822" name=
"xd21e2822src">62</a> that &ldquo;after every death among them, they
bring a long water-worn stone (devva kotta kallu), and put it into one
of the old cromlechs sprinkled over the N&#299;lgiri plateau. Some of
the larger of these have been found piled up to the cap-stone with such
pebbles, which must have been the work of generations. Occasionally,
too, the tribes mentioned make small cromlechs for burial purposes, and
place the long water-worn pebbles in them. Mr. Breeks reports that the
Kurumbas in the neighbourhood of the Rangasv&#257;mi peak and Barliar
burn their dead, and place a bone and a small round stone in the
s&#257;vu-mane (death-house)&mdash;an old cromlech.&rdquo; The
conjecture is hazarded by Fergusson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2825src"
href="#xd21e2825" name="xd21e2825src">63</a> that the Kurumbas are the
remnant of a great and widely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>spread race, who may have
erected dolmens. As bearing on the connection between Kurumbas and
Kurubas, it is worthy of note that the latter, in some places, erect
dolmens as a resting-place for the dead. (<i>See</i> Kuruba.)</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the N&#299;lgiris, that the
Kurumbas &ldquo;trade largely on the extraordinary dread of their
supposed magical powers which possesses the Todas and the
Badagas&mdash;the latter especially. Stories are told of how they can
summon wild elephants at will, and reduce rocks to powder merely by
scattering mystic herbs upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kurumbas,&rdquo; Harkness writes, &ldquo;have a knowledge
of herbs and medicinal roots, and the Burghers (Badagas) say that they
limit their knowledge thereof to those which are noxious only, and
believe that, with the assistance of their magic, they are able to
convey them into the stomachs of those to whom they have any dislike.
The violent antipathy existing between the Burghers and the Kurumbas,
and the dread and horror which the former entertain of the
preternatural powers of the latter, are, perhaps, not easily accounted
for; but neither sickness, death, nor misfortune of any kind, ever
visit the former, without the latter having the credit of producing it.
A few years before, a Burgher had been hanged by the sentence of the
provincial court for the murder of a Kurumba. The act of the former was
not without what was considered great provocation. Disease had attacked
the inhabitants of the hamlet, a murrain their cattle. The former had
carried off a great part of the family of the murderer, and he himself
had but narrowly escaped its effects. No one in the neighbourhood
doubted that the Kurumba in question had, by his necromancy, caused all
this misfortune, and, after several fruitless attempts, a party of them
succeeded in surrounding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>him in open day, and effecting
their purpose.&rdquo; In 1835 no less than forty-eight Kurumbas were
murdered, and a smaller number in 1875 and 1882. In 1900 a whole family
of Kurumbas was murdered, of which the head, who had a reputation as a
medicine-man, was believed to have brought disease and death into a
Badaga village. The sympathies of the whole country-side were so
strongly with the murderers that detection was made very difficult, and
the persons charged were acquitted.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2839src"
href="#xd21e2839" name="xd21e2839src">64</a> In this case several Todas
were implicated. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Mr. Grigg writes, &ldquo;a
curious fact that neither Kota, Irula, or Badaga will slay a Kurumba
until a Toda has struck the first blow, but, as soon as his sanctity
has been violated by a blow, they hasten to complete the murderous
work, which the sacred hand of the Toda has begun.&rdquo; The
Badaga&rsquo;s dread of the Kurumba is said to be so great that a
simple threat of vengeance has proved fatal. My Toda guide&mdash;a
stalwart representative of his tribe&mdash;expressed fear of walking
from Ootacamund to Kotagiri, a distance of eighteen miles along a
highroad, lest he should come to grief at the hands of Kurumbas; but
this was really a frivolous excuse to get out of accompanying me to a
distance from his domestic hearth. In like manner, Dr. Rivers records
that, when he went to Kotagiri, a Toda who was to accompany him made a
stipulation that he should be provided with a companion, as the
Kurambas were very numerous in that part. In connection with the Toda
legend of &Ouml;n, who created the buffaloes and the Todas, Dr. Rivers
writes that &ldquo;when &Ouml;n saw that his son was in Amnodr (the
world of the dead), he did not like to leave him there alone, and
decided to go away to the same place. So he called together all the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>people, and the buffaloes and the trees, to come
and bid him farewell. All the people came except a man of Kwodrdoni
named Arsankutan. He and his family did not come. All the buffaloes
came except the Arsaiir, the buffaloes of the Kwodroni ti (sacred
dairy). Some trees also failed to come. &Ouml;n blessed all the people,
buffaloes and trees present, but said that, because Arsankutan had not
come, he and his people should die by sorcery at the hands of the
Kurumbas, and that, because the Arsaiir had not come, they should be
killed by tigers, and that the trees which had not come should bear
bitter fruit. Since that time the Todas have feared the Kurumbas, and
buffaloes have been killed by tigers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the N&#299;lgiri hills, honey-combs are collected by J&#275;n
Kurumbas and Sh&#333;lagas. The supply of honey varies according to the
nature of the season, and is said to be especially plentiful and of
good quality when <i>Strobilanthes</i> flowers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2849src" href="#xd21e2849" name="xd21e2849src">65</a> The
Kurumbas are said to have incredibly keen eye-sight, gained from
constantly watching the bee to his hive. When they find a hive not
quite ready to take, they place a couple of sticks in a certain
position. This sign will prevent any other Kurumba from taking the
honey, and no Badaga or other hillman would meddle with it on any
account, for fear of being killed by sorcery.</p>
<p>Fortified by a liberal allowance of alcohol and tobacco, the
Kurumbas, armed with bamboo torches, will follow up at night the tracks
of a wounded &lsquo;bison&rsquo; (<i lang="la-x-bio">Bos gaurus</i>),
and bring back the head and meat to camp. A European sportsman recounts
that he has often seen his Kurumba shik&#257;ri (tracker) stop, and,
with the one word &ldquo;honey,&rdquo; point to the top of an adjacent
tree. &ldquo;How do <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173"
name="pb173">173</a>]</span>you know?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Oh! I saw
a bee&rdquo; was the answer given with the greatest nonchalance. On one
occasion he found himself close to a swarm of bees. The Kurumba, seeing
him hesitate, thrust his stick clean through the swarm, and, with the
bare remark &ldquo;No honey,&rdquo; marched on. The District Forest
Officer, when out shooting, had an easy shot at a stag, and missed it.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the Kurumba, pointing to a distant tree,
&ldquo;is your bullet.&rdquo; His trained sense of hearing no doubt
enabled him to locate the sound of the bullet striking the tree, and
his eyes, following the sound, instantly detected the slight blaze made
by the bullet on the bark. The visual acuity of a number of tribes and
castes inhabiting the mountains, jungles, and plains, has been
determined by Dr. W. H. R. Rivers and myself, by means of the Cohn
letter E method. And, though the jungle man, who has to search for his
food and mark the tracks or traces of wild beasts, undoubtedly
possesses a specially trained keenness of vision for the exigencies of
his primitive life, our figures show that, as regards ordinary visual
acuity, he has no advantage over the more highly civilised classes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kurumbas of the Mysore forests,&rdquo; Mr. Theobald
writes, &ldquo;make fire by friction. They follow the same method as
the Todas, as described by Mr. Thurston, but never use the powdered
charcoal in the cavity of the horizontal piece of wood which is held
down by their feet, or by a companion. The fine brown powder, formed
during the rotation of the longer vertical piece, gives sufficient
tinder, which soon ignites, and is then placed on a small piece of
cotton rag, rolled loosely, and gently blown until it is ignited. The
vertical stick is held between the palms, and has a reciprocal motion,
by the palms being moved in opposite directions, at the same
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>time using a strong downward pressure, which
naturally brings the palms to the bottom, when they are at once raised
to their original position, and the operation continued till the
naturally formed tinder ignites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his report on Forest Administration in Coorg, 1902&ndash;1903,
Mr. C. D&rsquo;A. McCarthy writes as follows concerning the Kurumbas,
who work for the Forest department. &ldquo;We experienced in connection
with the Kurumbas one of those apparent aberrations of sense and
intellect, the occurrence of which amongst this peculiar race was
foreshadowed in the last report. The Chief Commissioner is aware that,
in the interests of the Kurubas themselves, we substitute for a single
cash payment distributions to the same value of food-grains, clothes
and cash, in equal proportions of each. Now, seventy years ago, before
the annexation of Coorg, the Kurubas and similar castes were
pr&aelig;dial slaves of the dominant Coorgs, receiving no other
remuneration for service than food and clothing. In fact, this
institution, nothing less than real slavery, was not entirely broken up
until the great demand for local labour created by the opening up of
the country for coffee cultivation so late as 1860&ndash;1870, so that
the existing generation are still cognisant of the old state of
affairs. Last year, during the distribution of rewards for the
successful protection of the reserves that season from fire, it seems
that the idea was put into the heads of these people that our system of
remuneration, which includes the distribution of food and clothing, was
an attempt to create again at their expense a system of, as it were,
forest slavery; with the result that for a time nothing would induce
many of them to accept any form of remuneration for the work already
performed, much less to undertake the same duties for the approaching
season. It was some time, and after <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>no little trouble,
that the wherefore of this strange conduct was discovered, and the
suspicions aroused put at rest.&rdquo; In his report, 1904&ndash;1905,
Mr. McCarthy states that &ldquo;the local system of fire protection,
consisting of the utilisation of the Kuruba jungle population for the
clearing of fire lines and patrolling, and the payment of rewards
according to results, may now be said to be completely established in
Coorg. The Kurubas appear to have gained complete confidence in the
working of the system, and, provided the superior officers personally
see to the payment of the rewards, are evidently quite satisfied that
the deductions for failures are just and fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kurumbas are said to have been very useful in the mining
operations during the short life of the Wyn&#257;d gold-mines. A few
years ago, I received the skulls of two Kurumbas, who went after a
porcupine into a deserted tunnel on the Glenrock Gold-mining
Company&rsquo;s land in the Wyn&#257;d. The roof fell in on them, and
they were buried alive.</p>

<p>Concerning N&#257;yakas or Naikers and Kurumbas, Mr. F. W. F.
Fletcher writes to me as follows from Nellakotta, N&#299;lgiris.
&ldquo;It may be that in some parts of Wynaad there are people known
indifferently as Kurumbas and Shola N&#257;yakas; but I have no
hesitation in saying that the N&#257;yakas in my employ are entirely
distinct from the Kurumbas. The two classes do not intermarry; they do
not live together; they will not eat together. Even their prejudices
with regard to food are different, for a Kurumba will eat bison flesh,
and a N&#257;yaka will not. The latter stoutly maintains that he is
entirely distinct from, and far superior to, the Kurumba, and would be
grievously offended if he were classed as a Kurumba. The religious
ceremonies of the two tribes are also different. The N&#257;yakas have
separate temples, and worship separate gods. The chief Kurumba temple
in this part of the country is close to Pandalur, and here, especially
at the Bishu feast, the Kurumbas gather in numbers. My N&#257;yakas do
not recognise this temple, but have their place of worship in the heart
of the jungle, where they make their <span class="corr" id="xd21e2922"
title="Source: puja">p&#363;ja</span> (worship) under the direction of
their own priest. The N&#257;yakas will not attend the funeral of a
Kurumba; nor will they invite Kurumbas to the funeral of one of their
own tribe. There is a marked variation in their modes of life. The
Kurumba of this part lives in comparatively open country, in the belt
of deciduous forest lying between the gh&#257;ts proper and the foot of
the N&#299;lgiri plateau. Here he has been brought into contact with
European Planters, and is, comparatively speaking, civilised. The
N&#257;yaka has his habitat in the dense jungle of the gh&#257;ts, and
is essentially a forest nomad, living on honey, jungle fruits, and the
tuberous roots of certain jungle creepers. By constant association with
myself, my N&#257;yaka men have lost the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>fear of the white
man, which they entertained when I first came into the district; but
even now, if I visit the village of a colony who reside in the
prim&aelig;val forest, the women and children will hide themselves in
the jungle at sight of me. The superstitions of the two tribes are
different. Some N&#257;yakas are credited with the power of changing
themselves at will into a tiger, and of wreaking vengeance on their
enemies in that guise. And the Kurumba holds the N&#257;yaka in as much
awe as other castes hold the Kurumba. Lower down, on the flat below the
gh&#257;ts I am opening a rubber estate, and here I have another
N&#257;yaka colony, who differ in many respects from their congeners
above, although the two colonies are within five miles as the crow
flies. The low-country N&#257;yaka does his hair in a knot on one side
of his head, Malay&#257;lam fashion, and his speech is a patois of
Malay&#257;lam. The N&#257;yaka on the hills above has a mop of curly
hair, and speaks a dialect of his own quite distinct from the Kurumba
language, though both are derived from Kanarese. But that the
low-country people are merely a sept of the N&#257;yaka tribe is
evident from the fact that intermarriage is common amongst the two
colonies, and that they meet at the same temple for their annual
p&#363;ja. The priest of the hill colony is the p&#363;j&#257;ri for
both divisions of the N&#257;yakas, and the arbiter in all their
disputes.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p><b>Kurumo.</b>&mdash;The Kurumos are a caste of Oriya
agriculturists, found mainly in the Russellkonda t&#257;luk of Ganjam.
They are called Kurumo by Oriyas, and Kudumo by Telugus. There is a
tradition that their name is derived from Srikurmam in the Vizagapatam
district, where they officiated as priests in the Siva temple, and
whence they were driven northward. The Kurumos say that, at the present
day, some members <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178"
name="pb178">178</a>]</span>of the caste are priests at Saivite temples
in Ganjam, bear the title R&#257;vulo, and wear the sacred thread. It
is noted in the Madras Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;some of them
wear the sacred thread, and follow Chaitanya, and Oriya Br&#257;hmans
will accept drinking-water at their hands. They will eat in
Br&#257;hmans&rsquo; houses, and will accept drinking-water from
Gaudos, Bhond&#257;ris, and R&#257;vulos.&rdquo; Bhond&#257;ris wash
the feet of Kurumos on ceremonial occasions, and, in return for their
services, receive twice the number of cakes given to other guests at
feasts.</p>
<p>In addition to the Kurumos proper, there is a section called
K&#363;ji Kurumo, which is regarded as lower in the social status. The
caste titles are Bissoyi, B&#275;hara, Dudi, Majhi, N&#257;yako,
Podh&#257;no, R&#257;vulo, Ravuto, S&#275;n&#257;pati, and Udhdhandra.
Those who bear the title Dudi are priests at the temples of the village
deities. The title Udhdhandra was conferred by a zamindar, and is at
present borne by a number of families, intermarriage among members of
which is forbidden. Every village has a headman entitled Adhikari, who
is under the control of a chief headman called B&#275;hara. Both these
appointments are hereditary.</p>
<p>Among other deities, the Kurumos worship various T&#257;kur&#257;nis
(village deities), such as B&#333;do R&#257;vulo, B&#257;gha D&#275;vi,
Kumb&#275;swari, and Sathabhavuni. In some places, there are certain
marriage restrictions based on the house-gods. For example, a family
whose house-god is B&#333;do R&#257;vulo may not intermarry with
another family which worships the same deity. Every family of Kurumos
apparently keeps the house-god within the house, and it is worshipped
on all important occasions. The god is usually represented by five
areca nuts, which are kept in a box. These nuts must be filled with
pieces of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>gold, silver, iron, copper, and lead, which are
introduced through a hole drilled in the base of the nut, which is
plugged with silver.</p>
<p>Infant marriage is the rule, and, if a girl does not secure a
husband before she reaches maturity, she has to go through the
mock-marriage rite, called dharma bibha, with her grandfather or other
elder. On the evening of the day previous to that of the real marriage,
called gondo sona, the paternal aunt of the bridegroom goes to a tank
(pond), carrying thither a brass vessel. This is placed on the tank
bund (embankment), and worshipped. Some cowry (<i>Cypr&aelig;a
arabica</i>) shells are then thrown into the tank, and the vessel is
filled with water, and taken to the house. At the entrance thereto, a
Sullokhondia Gaudo stands, holding a vessel of water, from which a
little water is poured into the vessel brought from the tank. The
bride&rsquo;s aunt then goes to three or five houses of members of her
own caste, and receives water therefrom in her vessel, which is placed
near the house-gods, and eventually kept on the marriage dais
throughout the wedding ceremonies. Over the marriage dais (b&#275;di)
at the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, four brass vessels, and four clay
lamps fed with gh&#299; (clarified butter), are placed at the four
corners. Round the four posts thereof seven turns of thread are made by
a Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit. The bridegroom, wearing mokkuto (forehead
chaplet) and sacred thread, after going seven times round the dais,
breaks the thread, and takes his seat thereon. After <i>Zizyphus
Jujuba</i> leaves and rice have been thrown over him, he is taken in
procession to a temple. On his return home, he is met by five or seven
young girls and women at the entrance to the house, and <i>Zizyphus</i>
leaves are again thrown over him. A Bhond&#257;ri woman sprinkles water
from mango leaves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180"
name="pb180">180</a>]</span>over him, and he proceeds in a palanquin to
the home of the bride. At the marriage ceremony, the bride throws rice
on the head of the bridegroom over a screen which is interposed between
them. After their hands have been tied together, a grinding-stone and
roller are placed between them, and they face each other while their
fingers are linked together above the stone. On the seventh day, the
newly married couple worship seven posts at the bride&rsquo;s house.
The various articles used in connection with the marriage ceremonies,
except one pot, are thrown into a tank. On his return thence, the
bridegroom breaks the pot, after he has been sprinkled with the water
contained in it by a Bhond&#257;ri. At times of marriage, and on other
auspicious occasions, the Kurumos, when they receive their guests, must
take hold of their sticks or umbrellas, and it is regarded as an insult
if this is not done.</p>
<p>On the fifth and eighth days after the birth of a child, a new cloth
is spread on the floor, on which the infant is placed, with a book
(b&#257;gavatham) close to its head, and an iron rod, such as is used
by Oriya castes for branding the skin of the abdomen of newly-born
babies, at its side. The relations and friends assemble to take part in
the ceremonial, and a Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit reads a pur&#257;nam.
Betel leaves and areca nuts are then distributed. On the twenty-first
day, the ceremonial is repeated, and the pur&#333;hit is asked to name
the child. He ascertains the constellation under which it was born, and
announces that a name commencing with a certain letter should be given
to it.</p>
<p>Like other Oriya castes, the Kurumos are particular with regard to
the observation of various vratams (fasts). One, called sudasa vratam,
is observed on a Thursday falling on the tenth day after new moon in
the month <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>of Karthika (November-December). The most
elderly matron of the house does p&#363;ja (worship), and a
pur&#257;nam is read. Seven cubits of a thread dyed with turmeric are
measured on the forearm of a girl seven years old, and cut off. The
deity is worshipped, and seven knots are made in the piece of thread,
which is tied on to the left upper arm of the matron. This vratam is
generally observed by Oriya castes.</p>
<p><b>Kurup.</b>&mdash;In a note on the artisan classes of Malabar, it
is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2967src" href="#xd21e2967" name=
"xd21e2967src">67</a> that &ldquo;the Kolla-Kurups combine two
professions which at first sight seem strangely incongruous, shampooing
or massage, and the construction of the characteristic leather shields
of Malabar. But the two arts are intimately connected with the system
of combined physical training, as we should now call it, and exercise
in arms, which formed the curriculum of the kalari (gymnasium), and the
title kurup is proper to castes connected with that institution. A
similar combination is found in the Vil-Kurups (bow-Kurups), whose
traditional profession was to make bows and arrows, and train the youth
to use them, and who now shampoo, make umbrellas, and provide bows and
arrows for some N&#257;yar ceremonies. Other classes closely connected
are the Kollans or Kurups distinguished by the prefixes Ch&#257;ya
(colour), Palissa (shield), and T&#333;l (leather), who are at present
engaged in work in lacquer, wood, and leather.&rdquo; Kurup also occurs
as a title of N&#257;yars, in reference to the profession of arms, and
many of the families bearing this title are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2970src" href="#xd21e2970" name="xd21e2970src">68</a> to still
maintain their kalari.</p>
<p><b>Kuruvikk&#257;ran.</b>&mdash;The Kuruvikk&#257;rans are a class
of Mar&#257;thi-speaking bird-catchers and beggars, who hunt
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>jackals, make bags out of the skin, and eat the
flesh thereof. By Telugu people they are called Nakkalav&#257;ndlu
(jackal people), and by Tamilians Kuruvikk&#257;ran (bird-catchers).
They are also called J&#257;ngal J&#257;ti and K&#257;ttu Mahr&#257;ti.
Among themselves they are known as Vagiri or Vagirivala. They are
further known as Yeddu Marig&#275; V&#275;tag&#257;ndlu, or hunters who
hide behind a bullock. In decoying birds, they conceal themselves
behind a bullock, and imitate the cries of birds in a most perfect
manner. They are said to be called in Hindustani Paradhi and M&#299;r
Shik&#257;ri.</p>
<p>As regards their origin, there is a legend that there were once upon
a time three brothers, one of whom ran away to the mountains, and,
mixing with Kanna Kuruvans, became degraded. His descendants are now
represented by the Dommaras. The descendants of the second brother are
the Lamb&#257;dis, and those of the third Kuruvikk&#257;rans. The lowly
position of these three classes is attributed to the fact that the
three brothers, when wandering about, came across S&#299;ta, the wife
of R&#257;ma, about whose personal charms they made remarks, and
laughed. This made S&#299;ta angry, and she uttered the following
curse:&mdash;&ldquo;M&#257;litho shikar, naitho bhikar,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, if (birds) are found, huntsmen; if not, beggars. According
to a variant of the legend,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2985src" href=
"#xd21e2985" name="xd21e2985src">69</a> many years ago in
R&#257;jput&#257;na there lived two brothers, the elder of whom was
dull, and the younger smart. One day they happened to be driving a
bullock along a path by the side of a pool of water, when they
surprised S&#299;ta bathing. The younger brother hid behind his
bullock, but the elder was too stupid to conceal himself, and so both
were observed by the goddess, who was much <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>annoyed, and banished them to Southern India.
The elder she ordered to live by carrying goods about the country on
pack-bullocks, and the younger to catch birds by means of two snares,
which she obligingly formed from hair plucked from under her arm.
Consequently the Vagirivalas never shave that portion of the body.</p>
<p>The Kuruvikk&#257;rans are nomadic, and keep pack-bullocks, which
convey their huts and domestic utensils from place to place. Some earn
their living by collecting firewood, and others by acting as watchmen
in fields and gardens. Women and children go about the streets begging,
and singing songs, which are very popular, and imitated by Hindu women.
They further earn a livelihood by hawking needles and glass beads,
which they may be seen in the evening purchasing from Kayalans
(Muhammadan merchants) in the Madras bazar.</p>
<p>One of the occupations of the Kuruvikk&#257;rans is the manufacture
and sale of spurious jackal horns, known as narikompu. To catch the
jackals, they make an enclosure of a net, inside which a man seats
himself, armed with a big stick. He then proceeds to execute a perfect
imitation of the jackal&rsquo;s cry, on hearing which the jackals come
running to see what is the matter, and are beaten down. A
Kuruvikk&#257;ran, whom the Rev. E. L&ouml;venthal interviewed, howled
like a jackal, to show his skill as a mimic. The cry was quite perfect,
and no jackal would have doubted that he belonged to their class.
Sometimes the entire jackal&rsquo;s head is sold, skin and all. The
process of manufacture of the horn is as follows. After the brain has
been removed, the skin is stripped off a limited area of the skull, and
the bone at the place of junction of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>above the occipital foramen is filed away, so
that only a point, like a bony outgrowth, is left. The skin is then
brought back, and pressed over the little horn, which pierces it. The
horn is also said to be made out of the molar tooth of a dog or jackal,
introduced through a small hole in a piece of jackal&rsquo;s skin,
round which a little blood or turmeric paste is smeared, to make it
look more natural. In most cases only the horn, with a small piece of
skull and skin, is sold. Sometimes, instead of the skin from the part
where the horn is made, a piece of skin is taken from the snout, where
the long black hairs are. The horn then appears surrounded by long
black bushy hairs. The Kuruvikk&#257;rans explain that, when they see a
jackal with such long hairs on the top of its head, they know that it
possesses a horn. A horn-vendor, whom I interviewed, assured me that
the possessor of a horn is a small jackal, which comes out of its
hiding-place on full-moon nights to drink the dew. According to another
version, the horn is only possessed by the leader of a pack of jackals.
The Sinhalese and Tamils alike regard the horn &ldquo;as a talisman,
and believe that its fortunate possessor can command the realisation of
every wish. Those who have jewels to conceal rest in perfect security
if, along with them, they can deposit a narricomboo.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2997src" href="#xd21e2997" name=
"xd21e2997src">70</a> The ayah (nurse) of a friend who possessed such a
talisman remarked &ldquo;Master going into any law-court, sure to win
the case.&rdquo; This, as has been pointed out, does not show much
faith in the British administration of justice, if a so-called
jackal&rsquo;s horn can turn the scale. Two spurious horns, which I
possessed, were promptly stolen from my study table, to bring luck to
some Tamil member of my establishment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some Kuruvikk&#257;rans carry suspended from their turban or
body-cloth a small whistle, with which they imitate the song of birds,
and attract them. Young boys often have with them a bundle of small
sticks strung together, and with a horse-hair noose attached to them.
The sticks are driven into the ground, and grain is strewn around to
entice birds, which get caught in the noose.</p>
<p>The women wear a petticoat and an ill-fitting bodice. Among other
classes &ldquo;Wearing the bodice like a Kuruvikk&#257;ran woman&rdquo;
is used as a taunt. The petticoat may never be taken off till it is
tattered and torn, and replaced by a new one; and, when a woman bathes,
she has to do so with the garment on. Anything which has come in
contact with the petticoat, or rice husked with a woman&rsquo;s feet,
is polluted, and may not be used by men. Women adorn themselves with
necklaces of beads and cowry shells, or sometimes, like the
Lamb&#257;dis, wear shell bracelets. Both men and women stain their
teeth with a preparation of myrabolams, <i>Acacia arabica</i> pods, and
sulphates of copper and iron. Females may not blacken their teeth, or
wear a necklace of black beads before marriage.</p>
<p>A young married woman, wherever she may be during the daytime, must
rejoin her husband at night. If she fails to do so, she has to go
through the ordeal of grasping a red-hot iron bar or sickle, and
carrying it sixteen paces without dropping it. Another form of ordeal
is dipping the hands in a pot containing boiling cowdung water, and
picking out therefrom a quarter-anna piece. If the woman is innocent,
she is able to husk a small quantity of paddy (rice) by rubbing it
between her hands immediately after the immersion in the liquid. If a
man has to submit to trial by ordeal, seven arka (<i>Calotropis
gigantea</i>) leaves are tied to his palm, and a piece of red-hot
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>iron placed thereon. His innocence is
established if he is able to carry it while he takes seven long
strides.</p>
<p>The Kuruvikk&#257;rans have exogamous septs, of which
R&#257;narat&#333;d seems to be an important one, taking a high place
in the social scale. Males usually add the title Sing as a suffix to
their names.</p>
<p>Marriage is always between adults, and the celebration, including
the betrothal ceremony, extends over five days, during which meat is
avoided, and the bride keeps her face concealed by throwing her cloth
over it. Sometimes she continues to thus veil herself for a short time
after marriage. On the first day, after the exchange of betel, the
father of the bride says &ldquo;Are you ready to receive my daughter as
your daughter-in-law into your house? I am giving her to your son. Take
care of her. Do not beat her when she is ill. If she cannot carry
water, you should help her. If you beat her, or ill-treat her in any
way, she will come back to us.&rdquo; The future father-in-law having
promised that the girl will be kindly treated, the bridegroom says
&ldquo;I am true, and have not touched any other woman. I have not
smiled at any girl whom I have seen. Your daughter should not smile at
any man whom she sees. If she does so, I shall drive her back to your
house.&rdquo; In the course of the marriage ceremonies, the bride is
taken to the home of her mother-in-law, to whom she makes a present of
a new cloth. The Nyavya (headman) hands a string of black beads to the
mother-in-law, who ties it round the bride&rsquo;s neck, while the
assembled women sing. At a marriage of the first daughter of a member
of the R&#257;narat&#333;d sept, a Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit is invited
to be present, and give his blessing, as it is believed that a
Gujar&#257;ti Br&#257;hman was originally employed for the marriage
celebration. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>The principal tribal deity of the Kuruvikk&#257;rans is K&#257;li or
Durga, and each sept possesses a small plate with a figure of the
goddess engraved on it, which is usually kept in the custody of the
headman. It is, however, frequently pledged, and money-lenders give
considerable sums on the security of the idol, as the
Kuruvikk&#257;rans would on no account fail to redeem it. When the time
for the annual festival of the goddess draws nigh, the headman or an
elder piles up <i>Vigna Catiang</i> seeds in five small heaps. He then
decides in his mind whether there is an odd or even number of seeds in
the majority of heaps. If, when the seeds are counted, the result
agrees with his forecast, it is taken as a sign of the approval of the
goddess, and arrangements are made for the festival. Otherwise it is
abandoned for the year. On the day of the festival, nine goats and a
buffalo are sacrificed. While some cakes are being cooked in oil, a
member of the tribe prays that the goddess will descend on him, and,
taking some of the cakes out of the boiling liquid, with his palm rubs
the oil on his head. He is then questioned by those assembled, to whom
he gives oracular replies, after sucking the blood from the cut throat
of a goat. It is noted in the North Arcot Manual that the Vagirivalas
assemble two or three times in the year at Varad&#257;reddipalli for
worship. The objects of this are three saktis called Mahan K&#257;li,
Ch&#257;mundi, and Mahamm&#257;yi, represented by small silver figures,
which are mortgaged to a Reddi of the village, and lent by him during
the few days of the festival.</p>
<p><b>K&#363;sa.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Holeyas in South Canara,
who also call themselves Upp&#257;ra. Some of them say that they are
the same as Upp&#257;ras of Mysore, whose hereditary occupation was the
manufacture of salt <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"
name="pb188">188</a>]</span>from salt-earth (ku, earth). K&#363;sa
further occurs as a synonym of the Otattu, or tile-making section of
the N&#257;yars, and K&#363;sa M&#257;r&#257;n as a class of potters in
Travancore. K&#363;sa is also an exogamous sept of the B&#333;yas.</p>
<p><b>Kusavan.</b>&mdash;The Kusavans are the Tamil potters. &ldquo;The
name,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3035src" href="#xd21e3035" name="xd21e3035src">71</a> &ldquo;is
said to be derived from the Sanskrit word ku signifying earth, the
material in which they work, and avan, a personal termination. They
wear the sacred thread, and profess both Saivism and Vaishnavism. Their
ceremonials are somewhat like those of the Vell&#257;las. The eating of
flesh is permitted, but not widow marriage. Some have priests of their
own caste, while others employ Br&#257;hmans. Kusavans sometimes
officiate as p&#363;jaris in Pid&#257;ri temples. Their titles are
Udayan and V&#275;l&#257;n. Their stupidity and ignorance are
proverbial.&rdquo; At times of census, Kul&#257;lan has been returned
as a synonym of Kusavan, and Kusavan as an occupational division of
Paraiyans. The Kusavans are divided into the territorial sections
Ch&#333;la, Ch&#275;ra, and P&#257;ndya, and say that &ldquo;these are
descended from the three sons of their original ancestor Kul&#257;lan,
who was the son of Brahma. He prayed to Brahma to be allowed, like him,
to create and destroy things daily; so Brahma made him a
potter.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3038src" href="#xd21e3038"
name="xd21e3038src">72</a></p>
<p>In ancient days, the potters made the large pyriform sepulchral
urns, which have, in recent times, been excavated in Tinnevelly,
Madura, Malabar, and elsewhere. Dr. G. U. Pope shows<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3043src" href="#xd21e3043" name="xd21e3043src">73</a> that
these urns are mentioned in connection with the burial of heroes and
kings as late as the eighth century A.D., and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>renders one of the Tamil songs bearing on the
subject as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Oh! potter chief ... what toil hath befallen
thee!</p>
<p class="line">The descendant of the Cora kings....</p>
<p class="line">Hath gained the world of gods. And so</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis thine to shape an urn so vast</p>
<p class="line">That it shall cover the remains of such an
one.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The legend concerning the origin of the potter classes
is narrated in the article on Kummaras. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Mr. E.
Holder writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3062src" href="#xd21e3062"
name="xd21e3062src">74</a> &ldquo;supposed by themselves that they are
descended from a Br&#257;hmin father and S&#363;dra mother, for the
sacrificial earthen vessels, which are now made by them, were,
according to the V&#275;das, intended to be made by the priests
themselves. Some of the potters still wear the sacred thread, like the
Kamm&#257;lars or artisan class. They are generally illiterate, though
some of their class have earned distinction as sound scholars,
especially of late years. The women assist the men in their work,
chiefly where delicacy of execution is needed. On the whole, the
potters are a poor class compared with the Kamm&#257;lar class, which
includes jewellers, metal-workers and wood-workers. Their occupation
is, on that account, somewhat despised by others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The potter&rsquo;s apparatus is described by Monier
Williams<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3067src" href="#xd21e3067" name=
"xd21e3067src">75</a> as &ldquo;a simple circular horizontal
well-balanced fly-wheel, generally two or three feet in diameter, which
can be made to rotate for two or three minutes by a slight impulse.
This the potter loads with clay, and then, with a few easy sweeps and
turns of his hands, he moulds his material into beautiful curves and
symmetrical shapes, and leaves the products of his skill to bake
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>in the sun.&rdquo; By Mr. Holder the apparatus
is described as follows. &ldquo;The potter&rsquo;s implements are few,
and his mode of working is very simple. The wheel, a clumsily
constructed and defective apparatus, is composed of several thin
pliable pieces of wood or bamboo, bent and tied together in the form of
a wheel about 3&frac12; feet in diameter. This is covered over thickly
with clay mixed with goat&rsquo;s hair or any fibrous substance. The
four spokes and the centre on which the vessel rests are of wood. The
pivot is of hard wood or steel. The support for the wheel consists of a
rounded mass of clay and goat&rsquo;s hair, in which is imbedded a
piece of hard wood or stone, with one or two slight depressions for the
axle or pivot to move in. The wheel is set into motion first by the
hand, and then spun rapidly by the aid of a long piece of bamboo, one
end of which fits into a slight depression in the wheel. The defects in
the apparatus are&mdash;firstly its size, which requires the potter to
stoop over it in an uneasy attitude; secondly, the irregularity of its
speed, with a tendency to come to a standstill, and to wave or wobble
in its motion; and thirdly, the time and labour expended in spinning
the wheel afresh every time its speed begins to slacken.
Notwithstanding, however, the rudeness of this machine, the potters are
expert at throwing, and some of their small wares are thin and
delicate. The usual manner in which most of the Madras potters bake
their wares is as follows. A circular space, about ten feet in
diameter, is marked out on the ground in any convenient open spot.
Small pieces of wood and dried sticks are spread over this space to a
depth of about six inches, and a layer of brattis (dried cow-dung
cakes) laid over the sticks. The vessels are then carefully piled on
top of this platform of fuel to a height of about five or six feet,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>and the whole heap is covered over with straw,
and plastered over with clay, a few small openings being left here and
there to allow the smoke to escape. These arrangements being completed,
the fuel at the bottom is fired, and in the course of a few hours the
process of baking is completed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3075width" id="pl4-191"><img src=
"images/pl4-191.jpg" alt="Kusavans." width="720" height="511">
<p class="figureHead">Kusavans.</p>
</div>
<p>When travelling in India, Dr. Jagor noticed that the potters of
Salem communicated to their ware a kind of polish, exactly like that
seen on some of the specimens of antique pottery found in cromlechs. It
was ascertained that the Salem potters use a seed for producing the
polish, which was determined by Surgeon-General G. Bidie to be the seed
of <i lang="la-x-bio">Gyrocarpus Jacquini</i>, which is also used for
making rosaries and necklaces. Another method employed for producing a
polish is to rub the surface of the baked vessel with the mucilaginous
juice of tuthi (<i>Abutilon indicum</i>), and then fire the vessel
again.</p>
<p>It is stated, in the Coimbatore Manual, that &ldquo;the potter never
begins his day&rsquo;s work at the wheel without forming into a lingam
and saluting the revolving lump of clay, which, with the wheel, bears a
strong resemblance to the usual sculptured conjunction&rdquo; (of
lingam and y&#333;ni). An old potter woman, whom I examined on this
point, explained that the lump represents Gan&#275;sa. In like manner,
the pan coolies at the salt factories never scrape salt from the pans
without first making a Pillayar (Gan&#275;sa) of a small heap of salt,
on the top of which the salt is sometimes piled up.</p>
<p>Painted hollow clay images are made by special families of Kusavans
known as p&#363;j&#257;ri, who, for the privilege of making them, have
to pay an annual fee to the headman, who spends it on a festival at the
caste temple. When a married couple are anxious to have female
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>offspring, they take a vow to offer figures of
the seven virgins, who are represented all seated in a row. If a male
or female recovers from cholera, small-pox, or other severe illness, a
figure of the corresponding sex is offered. A childless woman makes a
vow to offer up the figure of a baby, if she brings forth offspring.
Figures of animals&mdash;cattle, sheep, horses, etc.&mdash;are offered
at the temple when they recover from sickness, or are recovered after
they have been stolen. The pupils of the eyes of the figures are not
painted in till they are taken to the temple, where offerings of fruit,
rice, etc., are first made. Even the pupils of a series of these
images, which were specially made for me, were not painted at the
potter&rsquo;s house, but in the verandah of the traveller&rsquo;s
bungalow where I was staying. Horses made of clay, hollow and painted
red and other colours, are set up in the fields to drive away demons,
or as a thank-offering for recovery from sickness or any piece of good
luck. The villagers erect these horses in honour of the popular deity
Ayanar, the guardian deity of the fields, who is a renowned huntsman,
and is believed, when, with his two wives Purna and Pushkala, he visits
the village at night, to mount the horses, and ride down the demons.
Ayanar is said to be &ldquo;the special deity of the caste. Kusavans
are generally the p&#363;j&#257;ris in his temples, and they make the
earthenware (and brick and mortar) horses and images, which are placed
before these buildings.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3093src"
href="#xd21e3093" name="xd21e3093src">76</a></p>
<p>For the following note on a ceremony, in which the potters take
part, I am indebted to an essay submitted in connection with the M.A.
degree of the Madras University. &ldquo;Br&#257;hmans of V&#275;dic
times ate dogs, horses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>bulls, and goats. The fondness for
mutton even in a raw state finds its modern counterpart in the bloody
hecatombs that disfigure some of their annual sacrifices. In these
ceremonies called Pasubandha, Agnishtoma, Vajapeya, Garudachayana,
etc., a goat is tied to a post, and, after the usual mantrams (prayers)
and the service of frankincense, etc., is ablutioned in water mixed
with turmeric and taken to the slaughter-room. And the method of
slaughtering is most appalling. Two men appointed for the purpose,
invariably men belonging to the pot-making community, rush into the
apartment. One catches hold of the fore-quarter of the animal and keeps
it from struggling, while the other squeezes the scrotum with so much
violence that the animal succumbs in a few minutes, after writhing in
the most painful fashion. The man in charge of the fore-quarter puts a
handful of salt into the animal&rsquo;s mouth, and holds it tight, lest
the animal should bleat, and make the ceremony unsanctimonious. The
carcase is now brought to the mailing shed, where, with crude knives
and untrained hands, the Br&#257;hmans peel off the skin most savagely.
Then they cut open the chest, and it is a common sight to see these
Br&#257;hmans, uninitiated in the art of butchery, getting their hands
severely poked or lacerated by the cut sharp ends of the ribs. Then
portions of flesh are cut off from various portions of the carcase,
such as the buccal region, the cardiac region, the scapular region, the
renal, the scrotal, the gluteal and gastroenemial regions. The amount
of flesh thus chopped comes to not less than three big potfuls, and
they are cooked in water over the slow fire of a primitively
constructed oven. No salt is put to season the meat, but the
Br&#257;hmans bolt it without any condiment in an awful
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3101width" id="pl4-193"><img src=

<p>The services of the potter are required in connection with the
marriage ceremonial of many castes. At some Br&#257;hman marriages, for
example, the t&#257;li is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck in the
presence of 33 crores (330 millions) of gods, who are represented by a
number of variously coloured pots, large and small. At a Ling&#257;yat
wedding, new pots are brought with much shouting, and deposited in the
room in which the household god is kept. An enclosure is made round the
bride and bridegroom with cotton thread passed round four pots placed
at the four corners of the marriage pandal. Among the
Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans, on the occasion of a wedding, a number of small
pots are set up in a room, and worshipped daily throughout the marriage
ceremonies. The ceremonial of breaking a pot containing water at the
graveside prevails among many classes, <i>e.g.</i>, Odd&#275;s,
Toreyas, and Paraiyans.</p>
<p>At the time of the Aruvaththim&#363;var festival, or festival of the
sixty-three saints, at Mylapore in the city of Madras, crowds may be
seen returning homeward after attending it, each carrying a new pot
(chatty), which they purchase so as not to go home empty-handed. At the
festival of Tiruvottiy&#363;r, stalks of <i>Amarantus gangeticus</i>
are in like manner purchased.</p>
<p>It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that &ldquo;a
Kusavan can claim the hand of his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter.
Marriage occurs before puberty. The t&#257;li is tied by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister, and the usual bride-price is paid. The
ceremonies last three days. One of them consists in the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister sowing seeds in a pot, and, on the last day
of the wedding, the seedlings which have sprouted are taken with music
to a river or tank (pond), and thrown into it. When the bride attains
maturity, a ceremony is conducted by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>caste priest, and
consummation follows on the next auspicious day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the Kusavans, divorce and remarriage are permissible on mutual
agreement, on one party paying to the other the expenses of the
latter&rsquo;s original marriage (parisam). A case came before the High
Court of Madras,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3123src" href="#xd21e3123"
name="xd21e3123src">77</a> in which a Kusavan woman in the Tinnevelly
district, on the ground of ill-treatment, repaid her husband the
parisam, thereby dissolving the marriage, and married another man.</p>
<p>The potters are considered to be adepts in the treatment of cases of
fracture. And it is still narrated how one of them successfully set in
splints the broken arm of Lord Elphinstone, when Governor of Madras,
after the English doctors had given up the job as hopeless.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3128src" href="#xd21e3128" name=
"xd21e3128src">78</a> &ldquo;In our village,&rdquo; it is
recorded,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3131src" href="#xd21e3131" name=
"xd21e3131src">79</a> &ldquo;cases of dislocations of bones and
fractures, whether simple, compound, comminuted or complicated, are
taken in hand by the bone-setters, who are no other than our potters.
The village barber and the village potter are our surgeons. While the
barber treats cases of boils, wounds, and tumours, the potter confines
himself to cases of fracture and dislocations of bones.&rdquo; The
amateur treatment by the unqualified potter sometimes gives rise to
what is known as potter&rsquo;s gangrene.</p>
<p>For the notes of the following case I am indebted to Captain F. F.
Elwes, I.M.S. A bricklayer, about a month and a half or two months
prior to admission into hospital, fell from a height, and injured his
left arm. He went to a potter, who placed the arm and forearm in a
splint, the former in a line with the latter, <i>i.e.</i>, fully
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>extended. He kept the splint on for about a
month and, when it was removed, found that he was unable to bend the
arm at the elbow-joint. When he was examined at the hospital,
practically no movement, either active or passive, could be obtained at
the elbow-joint. The lower end of the humerus could be felt to be
decidedly thickened both anteriorly and posteriorly. There had
apparently been a fracture of the lower end of the humerus.
R&ouml;ntgen ray photographs showed an immense mass of callus extending
over the anterior surface of the elbow-joint from about two and a half
inches above the lower end of the humerus to about an inch below the
elbow-joint. There was also some callus on the posterior surface of the
lower end of the humerus.</p>
<p>Concerning potter&rsquo;s gangrene, Captain W. J. Niblock, I.M.S.,
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3143src" href=
"#xd21e3143" name="xd21e3143src">80</a> &ldquo;Cases of gangrene, the
result of treatment of fractures by the village potters, used to be
frequently met with in the General Hospital, Madras. These were usually
brought when the only possible treatment consisted in amputation well
above the disease. Two of these cases are indelibly impressed on my
mind. Both were cases of gangrene of the leg, the result of tight
splinting by potters. The first patient was a boy of thirteen. Whilst a
student was removing the dressings on his admission, the foot came off
in his hands, leaving two inches of the lower ends of the tibia and
fibula exposed, and absolutely devoid of all the soft tissues, not even
the periosteum being left. The second case was that of a Hindu man,
aged 46. He was taken to the operation theatre at once. Whilst engaged
in disinfecting my hands, I heard a dull thud on the floor of the
operation theatre, turned round, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>found that the
gangrenous leg, as the result of a struggle whilst chloroform was being
administered, had become separated at the knee-joint, and had fallen on
floor; or, to put it tersely, the man had kicked his leg
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the Tamil proverb &ldquo;This is the law of my
caste, and this is the law of my belly,&rdquo; the Rev. H. Jensen
notes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3150src" href="#xd21e3150" name=
"xd21e3150src">81</a> that &ldquo;potters are never Vaishnavas; but
potters at Srirangam were compelled by the Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans to
put the Vaishnava mark on their foreheads; otherwise the Br&#257;hmans
would not buy their pots for the temple. One clever potter, having
considered the difficulty, after making the Saivite symbol on his
forehead, put a big Vaishnava mark on his stomach. When rebuked for so
doing by a Br&#257;hman, he replied as above.&rdquo; The proverb
&ldquo;Does the dog that breaks the pots understand how difficult it is
to pile them up?&rdquo; is said by Jensen to have reference to the pots
which are piled up at the potter&rsquo;s house. A variant is
&ldquo;What is many days&rsquo; work for the potter is but a few
moment&rsquo;s work for him who breaks the pots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Madura district, the Kusavans have V&#275;lan as a title.</p>

<p class="first"><b>Labbai.</b>&mdash;The Labbais are summed up, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as being &ldquo;a Musalman caste of partly
Tamil origin, the members of which are traders and betel vine (<i>Piper
Betle</i>) growers. They seem to be distinct from the Marakk&#257;yars,
as they do not intermarry with them, and their Tamil contains a much
smaller admixture of Arabic than that used by the Marakk&#257;yars. In
the Tanjore district, the Labbais are largely betel vine cultivators,
and are called Kodikk&#257;lk&#257;ran (betel vine people).&rdquo; In
the Census Report, 1881, the Labbais are said to be &ldquo;found
chiefly in Tanjore and Madura. They are the M&#257;ppilas of the
Coromandel coast, that is to say, converted Dravidians, or Hindus, with
a slight admixture of Arab blood. They are thrifty, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>industrious, and enterprising; plucky mariners,
and expert traders. They emigrate to the Straits Settlements and Burma
without restriction.&rdquo; In the Census Report, 1891, they are
described as &ldquo;a mixed class of Muhammadans, consisting partly of
compulsory converts to Isl&#257;m made by the early Muhammadan invaders
and Tippu Sult&#257;n.&rdquo; As regards their origin, Colonel Wilks,
the historian of Mysore, writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3211src" href="#xd21e3211" name="xd21e3211src">1</a> &ldquo;About
the end of the first century of the Hejirah, or the early part of the
eighth century A.D., Hijaj Ben Gusaff, Governor of Ir&#257;k, a monster
abhorred for his cruelties even among Musalmans, drove some persons of
the house of Hashem to the desperate resolution of abandoning for ever
their native country. Some of them landed on that part of the western
coast of India called the Concan, the others to the eastward of Cape
Comorin. The descendants of the former are Navaiyats, of the latter the
Labbai, a name probably given to them by the natives from that Arabic
particle (a modification of labbick) corresponding with the English
&lsquo;Here I am,&rsquo; indicating attention on being spoken to
[<i>i.e.</i>, the response of the servant to the call of his master. A
further explanation of the name is that the Labbais were originally few
in number, and were often oppressed by other Muhammadans and Hindus, to
whom they cried labbek, or we are your servants]. Another account says
they are the descendants of the Arabs, who, in the eleventh and and
twelfth centuries, came to India for trade. These Arabs were persecuted
by the Moghals, and they then returned to their country, leaving behind
their children born of Indian women. The word Labbai seems to be of
recent origin, for, in the Tamil lexicons, this caste is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>usually known as S&#333;nagan, <i>i.e.</i>, a
native of S&#333;nagam (Arabia), and this name is common at the present
day. Most of the Labbais are traders; some are engaged in weaving
c&#333;rah (sedge) mats; and others in diving at the pearl and chank
fisheries of the Gulf of Manaar. Tamil is their home-speech, and they
have furnished some fair Tamil poets. In religion they are orthodox
Musalmans. Their marriage ceremony, however, closely resembles that of
the lower Hindu castes, the only difference being that the former cite
passages from the Kor&#257;n, and their females do not appear in public
even during marriages. Girls are not married before puberty. Their
titles are Marakk&#257;yan (Marakalar, boatmen), and R&#257;vuttan (a
horse soldier). Their first colony appears to have been
K&#257;yalpatnam in the Tinnevelly district.&rdquo; In the Manual of
the Madura district, the Labbais are described as &ldquo;a fine,
strong, active race, who generally contrive to keep themselves in easy
circumstances. Many of them live by traffic. Many are smiths, and do
excellent work as such. Others are fishermen, boatmen, and the like.
They are to be found in great numbers in the Zamindaris, particularly
near the sea-coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the use of a Malay blow-gun (glorified pea-shooter) by
the Labbais of the Madura district, Dr. N. Annandale writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3225src" href="#xd21e3225" name=
"xd21e3225src">2</a> &ldquo;While visiting the sub-division of
R&#257;mn&#257;d in the coast of the Madura district in 1905, I heard
that there were, among the Muhammadan people known locally as Lubbais
or Labbis, certain men who made a livelihood by shooting pigeons with
blow-guns. At Kilakarai, a port on the Gulf of Manaar, I was able to
obtain a specimen, as well as particulars. According to my Labbi
informants, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>the &lsquo;guns&rsquo; are purchased by them in
Singapore from Bugis traders, and brought to India. There is still a
considerable trade, although diminished, between Kilakarai and the
ports of Burma and the Straits Settlements. It is carried on entirely
by Muhammadans in native sailing vessels, and a large proportion of the
Musalmans of Kilakarai have visited Penang and Singapore. It is not
difficult to find among them men who can speak Straits Malay. The local
name for the blow-gun is sengutt&#257;n, and is derived in popular
etymology from the Tamil sen (above) and kutu (to stab). I have little
doubt that it is really a corruption of the Malay name of the
weapon&mdash;sumpitan. The blow-gun which I obtained measures 189.6 cm.
in length: its external diameter at the breech is 30mm., and at the
other extremity 24 mm. The diameter of the bore, however, is
practically the same throughout, viz., 12 mm. Both ends are overlaid
with tin, and the breech consists of a solid piece of tin turned on a
lathe and pierced, the diameter of the aperture being the same as that
of the bore. The solid tin measures 35 mm. in length, and is continuous
with the foil which covers the base of the wooden tube. The tube itself
is of very hard, heavy, dark wood, apparently that of a palm. It is
smooth, polished and regular on its outer surface, and the bore is
extremely true and even. At a distance of 126 mm. from the distal
extremity, at the end of the foil which protects the tip of the weapon,
a lump of mud is fixed on the tube as a &lsquo;sight.&rsquo; The
ornamentation of the weapon is characteristic, and shows that it must
have been made in North Borneo. It consists of rings, leaf-shaped
designs with an open centre, and longitudinal bars, all inlaid with
tin. The missiles used at Kilakarai were not darts, but little
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>pellets of soft clay worked with the fingers
immediately before use. The use of pellets instead of darts is probably
an Indian makeshift. Although a &lsquo;sight&rsquo; is used in some
Bornean blow-guns, I was told, probably correctly, that the lump of mud
on the Kilakarai specimen had been added in India. I was told that it
was the custom at Kilakarai to lengthen the tin breech of the
&lsquo;gun&rsquo; in accordance with the capacity of the owner&rsquo;s
lungs. He first tried the tube by blowing a pellet through it, and, if
he felt he could blow through a longer tube, he added another piece of
tin at the proximal end. The pellet is placed in the mouth, into which
the butt of the tube is also introduced. The pellet is then worked into
the tube with the tongue, and is propelled by a violent effort of the
lungs. No wadding is used. Aim is rendered inaccurate, in the first
place by the heaviness of the tube, and secondly by the unsuitable
nature of the missile.&rdquo; A toy blow-gun is also figured by Dr.
Annandale, such as is used as a plaything by Labbai boys, and
consisting of a hollow cane with a piece of tinned iron twisted round
the butt, and fastened by soldering the two ends together. I have
received from the Madura district a blowpipe consisting of a long
black-japanned tin tube, like a billiard-cue case, with brass fittings
and terminals.</p>
<p>In connection with the dugong (<i>Halicore dugong</i>), which is
caught in the Gulf of Manaar, Dr. Annandale writes as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3237src" href="#xd21e3237" name="xd21e3237src">3</a>
&ldquo;The presence of large glands in connection with the eye afforded
some justification for the Malay&rsquo;s belief that the Dugong weeps
when captured. They regard the tears of the &#299;kandugong
(&lsquo;Dugong fish&rsquo;) as a powerful love-charm. Muhammadan
fishermen on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>the Gulf of Manaar appeared to be ignorant of
this usage, but told me that a &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; once went out with
them to collect the tears of a Dugong, should they capture one. Though
they do not call the animal a fish, they are less particular about
eating its flesh than are the Patani Malays and the Trang Samsams, who
will not do so unless the &lsquo;fish&rsquo;s&rsquo; throat has been
cut in the manner orthodox for warm-blooded animals. The common Tamil
name for the Dugong is kadalp&#363;dru (&lsquo;sea-pig&rsquo;); but the
fishermen at Kilakarai (Lubbais) call it &#257;vill&#299;ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the Labbais of the South Arcot district, Mr. W. Francis
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3244src" href=
"#xd21e3244" name="xd21e3244src">4</a> &ldquo;The Labbais are often
growers of betel, especially round about Nellikuppam, and they also
conduct the skin trade of the district, are petty shop-keepers, and
engage in commerce at the ports. Their women are clever at weaving mats
from the screw-pine (<i>Pandanus fascicularis</i>), which grows so
abundantly along the sandy shore of the Bay of Bengal. The Labbais very
generally wear a high hat of plaited coloured grass, and a tartan
(kamb&#257;yam) waist-cloth, and so are not always readily
distinguishable in appearance from the Marakk&#257;yars, but some of
them use the Hindu turban and waist-cloth, and let their womankind
dress almost exactly like Hindu women. In the same way, some Labbais
insist on the use of Hindust&#257;ni in their houses, while others
speak Tamil. There seems to be a growing dislike to the introduction of
Hindu rites into domestic ceremonies, and the processions and music,
which were once common at marriages, are slowly giving place to a
simpler ritual more in resemblance with the nikka ceremony of the
Musalman faith.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a note on the Labbais of the North Arcot district,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3253src" href="#xd21e3253" name="xd21e3253src">5</a>
Mr. H. A. Stuart describes them as being &ldquo;very particular
Muhammadans, and many belong to the W&#257;habi section. Adhering to
the rule of the Kor&#257;n, most of them refuse to lend money at
interest, but get over the difficulty by taking a share in the profits
derived by others in their loans. They are, as a rule, well-to-do, and
excellently housed. The first thing a Labbai does is to build himself a
commodious tiled building, and the next to provide himself with gay
attire. They seem to have a prejudice against repairing houses, and
prefer letting them go to ruin, and building new ones. The ordinary
Musalmans appear to entertain similar ideas on this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some Kodikk&#257;lk&#257;ran Labbais have adopted Hindu customs in
their marriage ceremonies. Thus a bamboo is set up as a milk-post, and
a t&#257;li is tied round the neck of the bride while the Nikkadiva is
being read. In other respects, they practice Muhammadan rites.</p>
<p>Concerning the Labbais who have settled in the Mysore province, I
gather<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3260src" href="#xd21e3260" name=
"xd21e3260src">6</a> that they are &ldquo;an enterprising class of
traders, settled in nearly all the large towns. They are vendors of
hardware and general merchants, collectors of hides, and large traders
in coffee produce, and generally take up any kind of lucrative
business. It is noteworthy, as denoting the perseverance and pushing
character of the race that, in the large village of Garg&#275;svari in
Tirumak&#363;dlu, Narsipur t&#257;luk, the Labb&#275;s have acquired by
purchase or otherwise large extents of river-irrigated lands, and have
secured to themselves the leadership among the villagers within a
comparatively recent period.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the purpose of the education of Labbai and Marakk&#257;yar
children, the Kor&#257;n and other books have been published in the
Tamil language, but with Arabic characters. Concerning these Arab-Tamil
books I gather that &ldquo;when a book thus written is read, it is
hardly possible to say that it is Tamil&mdash;it sounds like Arabic,
and the guttural sounds of certain words have softened down into Arabic
sounds. Certain words, mostly of religious connection, have been
introduced, and even words of familiar daily use. For instance, a
Labbai would not use the familiar word Annai for brother, Tagappan for
father, or Chithammai for aunt, but would call such relatives Bhai,
Bava, and Khula. Since the books are written in Arabic characters, they
bear a religious aspect. The Labbai considers it a sacred and
meritorious duty to publish them, and distribute them gratis among the
school-going children. A book so written or printed is called a
kit&#257;b, rather than its Tamil equivalent pustagam, and is
considered sacred. It commands almost the same respect as the
Kor&#257;n itself, in regard to which it has been commanded
&lsquo;Touch not with unclean hands.&rsquo; A book of a religious
nature, written or printed in Tamil characters, may be left on the
ground, but a kitab of even secular character will always be placed on
a rihal or seat, and, when it falls to the ground, it is kissed and
raised to the forehead. The origin of this literature may be traced to
K&#257;yalpatnam, M&#275;lap&#257;layam, and other important Labbai
towns in the Tinnevelly district.&rdquo; The following rendering of the
second Kalima will serve as an example of Arab-Tamil.</p>

<p><b>L&#257;dar.</b>&mdash;It is noted, in the Mysore Census Report,
1901, that &ldquo;the L&#257;dars are a class of general merchants,
found chiefly in the cities, where they supply all kinds of stores,
glass-ware, etc.&rdquo; I gather<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3281src"
href="#xd21e3281" name="xd21e3281src">7</a> that the &ldquo;L&#257;d or
Suryavaunshi V&#257;nis say that they are the children of Surya, the
sun. They are said to have come from Benares to Maisur under pressure
of famine about 700 years ago. But their caste name seems to show that
their former settlement was not in Benares, but in South Gujar&#257;t
or L&#257;t Desh. They are a branch of the L&#257;d community of
Maisur, with whom they have social intercourse. They teach their boys
to read and write Kanarese, and succeed as traders in grain, cloth, and
groceries.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>L&#257;la.</b>&mdash;The names of some Bondilis, or immigrants
from Bandelkand, who have settled in the North Arcot district and other
localities, terminate with L&#257;la. L&#257;la also occurs as a
synonym for K&#257;yasth, the writer caste of Bengal, immigrants from
Northern India, who have settled in Madras, where there are a number of
families. &ldquo;In Madras,&rdquo; Mr. S. M. Natesa Sastri informs
us,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3288src" href="#xd21e3288" name=

or in common for a whole street, an image of Holika, sing obscene songs
before it, offer sweetmeats, fruits and other things in mock worship of
the image, exchange horseplay compliments by syringing coloured water

jolly occasion. At about 1 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> on the full
moon day, the image of Holika is burnt, and children sit round the
embers, and beat their mouths, making a mock mourning sound. Tender
children are swung over the fire for a second by the fond mothers, and
this is believed to remove all kinds of danger from the
babies.&rdquo;</p>

Lamb&#257;ni, Brinj&#257;ri or Banj&#257;ri, Boip&#257;ri, Sug&#257;li
or Suk&#257;li. By some Sug&#257;li is said to be a corruption of
sup&#257;ri (betel nut), because they formerly traded largely
therein.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3304src" href="#xd21e3304" name=

their principal sub-castes is known under the name of
Labh&#257;n&#299;, and this name (or some related one) is often applied
to the whole tribe. The two names appear each under many variations,
such as Banj&#257;ri, Vanj&#257;r&#299;, Brinj&#257;r&#299;,
Labh&#257;ni, Lab&#257;n&#299;, Lab&#257;n&#257;, Lamb&#257;di, and
Lamb&#257;n&#299;. The name Banj&#257;ra and its congeners is probably
derived from the Sanskrit V&#257;nijyak&#257;rakas, a merchant, through
the Prakrit V&#257;nijja&#257;ra&#333;, a trader. The derivation of
Labh&#257;n&#299; or Lab&#257;n&#299;, etc., is obscure. It has been
suggested that it means salt carrier from the Sanskrit lavanah, salt,
because the tribe carried salt, but this explanation goes against
several phonetic rules, and does not account for the forms <span class=

falls into two main dialects&mdash;that of the Panjab and Gujarat, and
that of elsewhere (of which we may take the Labh&#257;n&#299; of Berar
as the standard). All these different dialects are ultimately to be
referred to the language of Western Rajputana. The Labh&#257;n&#299; of
Berar possesses the characteristics of an old form of speech, which has
been preserved unchanged for some centuries. It may be said to be based
partly on M&#257;rw&#257;ri and partly on Northern
Gujar&#257;t&#299;.&rdquo; It is noted by Mr. Grierson that the
Banj&#257;r&#299; dialect of Southern India is mixed with the
surrounding Dravidian languages. In the Census Report, 1901, Tanda (the
name of the Lamb&#257;di settlements or camps), and V&#257;li
Sugr&#299;va are given as synonyms for the tribal name. V&#257;li and
Sugr&#299;va were two monkey chiefs mentioned in the
R&#257;m&#257;yana, from whom the Lamb&#257;dis claim to be descended.
The legend, as given by Mr. F. S. Mullaly,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3315src" href="#xd21e3315" name="xd21e3315src">12</a> is that
&ldquo;there were two brothers, M&#333;ta and M&#333;la, descendants of
Sugr&#299;va. M&#333;la had no issue, so, being an adept in gymnastic
feats, he went with his wife Radha, and exhibited his skill at
&lsquo;Rathanatch&rsquo; before three r&#257;jahs. They were so taken
with M&#333;la&rsquo;s skill, and the grace and beauty of Radha, and of
her playing of the nag&#257;ra or drum, that they asked what they could
do for them. M&#333;la asked each of the r&#257;jahs for a boy, that he
might adopt him as his son. This request was accorded, and M&#333;la
adopted three boys. Their names were Chavia, Lohia Panchar, and
Rat&#257;de. These three boys, in course of time, grew up and married.
From Bheekya, the eldest son of Rat&#257;de, started the clan known as
the Bhutyas, and from this clan three minor sub-divisions known as the
Maigavuth, Kurumtoths, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>and Kholas. The Bhutyas form the
principal class among the Lamb&#257;dis.&rdquo; According to another
legend,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3321src" href="#xd21e3321" name=
"xd21e3321src">13</a> &ldquo;one Ch&#257;da left five sons, M&#363;la,
M&#333;ta, Nath&#257;d, J&#333;gd&#257;, and Bh&#299;md&#257;.
Chav&#257;n (Chauh&#257;n), one of the three sons of M&#363;la, had six
sons, each of whom originated a clan. In the remote past, a
Br&#257;hman from Ajmir, and a Mar&#257;ta from J&#333;tpur in the
north of India, formed alliances with, and settled among these people,
the Mar&#257;ta living with Rath&#333;l, a brother of Chav&#257;n. The
Br&#257;hman married a girl of the latter&rsquo;s family, and his
offspring added a branch to the six distinct clans of Chav&#257;n.
These clans still retain the names of their respective ancestors, and,
by reason of cousinship, intermarriage between some of them is still
prohibited. They do, however, intermarry with the Br&#257;hman
offshoot, which was distinguished by the name of Vadty&#257;, from
Chav&#257;n&rsquo;s family. Those belonging to the Vadty&#257; clan
still wear the sacred thread. The Mar&#257;ta, who joined the
Rath&#333;l family, likewise founded an additional branch under the
name of Khamdat to the six clans of the latter, who intermarry with
none but the former. It is said that from the Khamdat clan are
recruited most of the Lamb&#257;di dacoits. The clan descended from
M&#333;ta, the second son of Ch&#257;da, is not found in the Mysore
country. The descendants of Nath&#257;d, the third son, live by
catching wild birds, and are known as Mirasikat, Paradi, or V&#257;gri
(<i>see</i> Kuruvikk&#257;ran). The J&#333;gd&#257;s are people of the
J&#333;gi caste. Those belonging to the Bh&#299;md&#257; family are the
peripatetic blacksmiths, called Bailu Kamm&#257;ra. The Lamb&#257;ni
outcastes compose a sub-division called Th&#257;lya, who, like the
Holayas, are drum-beaters, and live in detached habitations.&rdquo;

<p>As pointing to a distinction between Suk&#257;lis and Banj&#257;ris,
it is noted by the Rev. J. Cain<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3330src"
href="#xd21e3330" name="xd21e3330src">14</a> that &ldquo;the
Suk&#257;l&#299;lu do not travel in such large companies as the
Banj&#257;r&#299;lu, nor are their women dressed as gaudily as the
Banj&#257;ri women. There is but little friendship between these two
classes, and the Suk&#257;li would regard it as anything but an honour
to be called a Banj&#257;ri, and the Banj&#257;ri is not flattered when
called a Suk&#257;li.&rdquo; It is, however, noted, in the Madras
Census Report, 1891, that enquiries show that Lamb&#257;dis and
Sug&#257;lis are practically the same. And Mr. H. A. Stuart, writing
concerning the inhabitants of the North Arcot district, states that the
names Sug&#257;li, Lamb&#257;di and Brinj&#257;ri &ldquo;seem to be
applied to one and the same class of people, though a distinction is
made. The Sug&#257;lis are those who have permanently settled in the
district; the Lamb&#257;dis are those who commonly pass through from
the coast to Mysore; and the Brinj&#257;ris appear to be those who come
down from Hyderabad or the Central Provinces.&rdquo; It is noted by Mr.
W. Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3333src" href="#xd21e3333" name=
"xd21e3333src">15</a> that, in the Bellary district, the Lamb&#257;dis
do not recognise the name Sug&#257;li.</p>
<p>Orme mentions the Lamb&#257;dis as having supplied the Comte de
Bussy with store, cattle and grain, when besieged by the Nizam&rsquo;s
army at Hyderabad. In an account of the Brinj&#257;ris towards the
close of the eighteenth century, Moor<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3338src" href="#xd21e3338" name="xd21e3338src">16</a> writes that
they &ldquo;associate chiefly together, seldom or never mixing with
other tribes. They seem to have no home, nor character, but that of
merchants, in which capacity they travel great distances to whatever
parts are most in want of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>merchandise, which is the greatest
part corn. In times of war they attend, and are of great assistance to
armies, and, being neutral, it is a matter of indifference to them who
purchase their goods. They marched and formed their own encampments
apart, relying on their own courage for protection; for which purpose
the men are all armed with swords or matchlocks. The women drive the
cattle, and are the most robust we ever saw in India, undergoing a
great deal of labour with apparent ease. Their dress is peculiar, and
their ornaments are so singularly chosen that we have, we are
confident, seen women who (not to mention a child at their backs) have
had eight or ten pounds weight in metal or ivory round their arms and
legs. The favourite ornaments appear to be rings of ivory from the
wrist to the shoulder, regularly increasing in size, so that the ring
near the shoulder will be immoderately large, sixteen or eighteen
inches, or more perhaps in circumference. These rings are sometimes
dyed red. Silver, lead, copper, or brass, in ponderous bars, encircle
their shins, sometimes round, others in the form of festoons, and truly
we have seen some so circumstanced that a criminal in irons would not
have much more to incommode him than these damsels deem ornamental and
agreeable trappings on a long march, for they are never dispensed with
in the hottest weather. A kind of stomacher, with holes for the arms,
and tied behind at the bottom, covers their breast, and has some
strings of cowries,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3343src" href=
"#xd21e3343" name="xd21e3343src">17</a> depending behind, dangling at
their backs. The stomacher is curiously studded with cowries, and their
hair is also bedecked with them. They wear likewise ear-rings,
necklaces, rings on the fingers and toes, and, we think, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>the
nut or nose jewel. They pay little attention to cleanliness; their
hair, once plaited, is not combed or opened perhaps for a month; their
bodies or cloths are seldom washed; their arms are indeed so encased
with ivory that it would be no easy matter to clean them. They are
chaste and affable; any indecorum offered to a woman would be resented
by the men, who have a high sense of honour on that head. Some are men
of great property; it is said that droves of loaded bullocks, to the
number of fifty or sixty thousand, have at different times followed the
Bhow&rsquo;s army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lamb&#257;dis of Bellary &ldquo;have a tradition among them of
having first come to the Deccan from the north with Moghul camps as
commissariat carriers. Captain J. Briggs, in writing about them in
1813, states that, as the Deccan is devoid of a single navigable river,
and has no roads that admit of wheeled traffic, the whole of the
extensive intercourse is carried on by laden bullocks, the property of
the Banj&#257;ris.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3358src" href=
"#xd21e3358" name="xd21e3358src">18</a> Concerning the Lamb&#257;dis of
the same district, Mr. Francis writes that &ldquo;they used to live by
pack-bullock trade, and they still remember the names of some of the
generals who employed their forebears. When peace and the railways came
and did away with these callings, they fell back for a time upon crime
as a livelihood, but they have now mostly taken to agriculture and
grazing.&rdquo; Some Lamb&#257;dis are, at the present time (1908),
working in the Mysore manganese mines.</p>
<p>Writing in 1825, Bishop Heber noted<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3363src" href="#xd21e3363" name="xd21e3363src">19</a> that
&ldquo;we passed a number of Brinjarees, who were carrying salt. They
all had bows, arrows, sword and shield. Even the children had, many of
them, bows and arrows suited to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213"
href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>their strength, and I saw one
young woman equipped in the same manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Lamb&#257;dis in time of war, the Abb&eacute; Dubois inform
us<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3370src" href="#xd21e3370" name=
"xd21e3370src">20</a> that &ldquo;they attach themselves to the army
where discipline is least strict. They come swarming in from all parts,
hoping, in the general disorder and confusion, to be able to thieve
with impunity. They make themselves very useful by keeping the market
well supplied with the provisions that they have stolen on the march.
They hire themselves and their large herds of cattle to whichever
contending party will pay them best, acting as carriers of the supplies
and baggage of the army. They were thus employed, to the number of
several thousands, by the English in their last war with the Sultan of
Mysore. The English, however, had occasion to regret having taken these
untrustworthy and ill-disciplined people into their service, when they
saw them ravaging the country through which they passed, and causing
more annoyance than the whole of the enemy&rsquo;s army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is noted by Wilks<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3375src" href=
"#xd21e3375" name="xd21e3375src">21</a> that the travelling grain
merchants, who furnished the English army under Cornwallis with grain
during the Mysore war, were Brinj&#257;ris, and, he adds, &ldquo;they
strenuously objected, first, that no capital execution should take
place without the sanction of the regular judicial authority; second,
that they should be punishable for murder. The executions to which they
demanded assent, or the murders for which they were called to account,
had their invariable origin in witchcraft, or the power of
communication with evil spirits. If a child sickened, or a wife was
inconstant, the sorcerer was to be discovered and punished.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>It is recorded by the Rev. J. Cain that many of
the Lamb&#257;dis &ldquo;confessed that, in former days, it was the
custom among them before starting out on a journey to procure a little
child, and bury it in the ground up to the shoulders, and then drive
their loaded bullocks over the unfortunate victim, and, in proportion
to their thoroughly trampling the child to death, so their belief in a
successful journey increased. A Lamb&#257;di was seen repeating a
number of mantrams (magical formul&aelig;) over his patients, and
touching their heads at the same time with a book, which was a small
edition of the Telugu translation of St. John&rsquo;s gospel. Neither
the physician nor patient could read, and had no idea of the contents
of the book.&rdquo; At the time when human (meriah) sacrifices
prevailed in the Vizagapatam Agency tracts, it was the regular duty of
Lamb&#257;dis to kidnap or purchase human beings in the plains, and
sell them to the hill tribes for extravagant prices. A person, in order
to be a fitting meriah, had to be purchased for a price.</p>
<p>It is recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3383src" href="#xd21e3383"
name="xd21e3383src">22</a> that not long after the accession of
Vin&#257;yaka Deo to the throne of Jeypore, in the fifteenth century,
some of his subjects rose against him, but he recovered his position
with the help of a leader of Brinj&#257;ris. Ever since then, in
grateful recognition, his descendants have appended to their signatures
a wavy line (called valatradu), which represents the rope with which
Brinj&#257;ris tether their cattle.</p>
<p>The common occupation of the Lamb&#257;dis of Mysore is
said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3388src" href="#xd21e3388" name=
"xd21e3388src">23</a> to be &ldquo;the transport, especially in the
hill and forest tracts difficult of access, of grain and other produce
on pack bullocks, of which they keep large herds. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>live
in detached clusters of rude huts, called thandas, at some distance
from established villages. Though some of them have taken of late to
agriculture, they have as yet been only partially reclaimed from
criminal habits.&rdquo; The thandas are said to be mostly pitched on
high ground affording coigns of vantage for reconnoissance in predatory
excursions. It is common for the Lamb&#257;dis of the Vizagapatam
Agency, during their trade peregrinations, to clear a level piece of
land, and camp for night, with fires lighted all round them. Mr. C.
Hayavadana Rao informs me that &ldquo;they regard themselves as immune
from the attacks of tigers, if they take certain precautions. Most of
them have to pass through places infested with these beasts, and their
favourite method of keeping them off is as follows. As soon as they
encamp at a place, they level a square bit of ground, and light fires
in the middle of it, round which they pass the night. It is their firm
belief that the tiger will not enter the square, from fear lest it
should become blind, and eventually be shot. I was once travelling
towards Malkangiri from Jeypore, when I fell in with a party of these
people encamped in the manner described. At that time, several villages
about Malkangiri were being ravaged by a notorious man-eater (tiger).
In the Madras Census Reports the Lamb&#257;dis are described as a class
of traders, herdsmen, cattle-breeders, and cattle-lifters, found
largely in the Deccan districts, in parts of which they have settled
down as agriculturists. In the Cuddapah district they are said<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3393src" href="#xd21e3393" name=
"xd21e3393src">24</a> to be found in most of the jungly tracts, living
chiefly by collecting firewood and jungle produce. In the Vizagapatam
district, Mr. G. F. Paddison informs me, the bullocks of the
Lamb&#257;dis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>are ornamented with peacock&rsquo;s feathers and
cowry shells, and generally a small mirror on the forehead. The
bullocks of the Brinj&#257;ris (Boiparis) are described by the Rev. G.
Gloyer<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3398src" href="#xd21e3398" name=
"xd21e3398src">25</a> as having their horns, foreheads, and necks
decorated with richly embroidered cloth, and carrying on their horns,
plumes of peacock&rsquo;s feathers and tinkling bells. When on the
march, the men always have their mouths covered, to avoid the awful
dust which the hundreds of cattle kick up. Their huts are very
temporary structures made of wattle. The whole village is moved about a
furlong or so every two or three years&mdash;as early a stage of the
change from nomadic to a settled life as can be found.&rdquo; The
Lamb&#257;di tents, or p&#257;ls, are said by Mr. Mullaly to be
&ldquo;made of stout coarse cloth fastened with ropes. In moving camp,
these habitations are carried with their goods and chattels on pack
bullocks.&rdquo; Concerning the Lamb&#257;dis of the Bellary district
Mr. S. P. Rice writes to me as follows. &ldquo;They are wood-cutters,
carriers, and coolies, but some of them settle down and become
cultivators. A Lamb&#257;di hut generally consists of only one small
room, with no aperture except the doorway. Here are huddled together
the men, women, and children, the same room doing duty as kitchen,
dining and bedroom. The cattle are generally tied up outside in any
available spot of the village site, so that the whole village is a sort
of cattle pen interspersed with huts, in whatsoever places may have
seemed convenient to the particular individual. Dotted here and there
are a few shrines of a modest description, where I was told that fires
are lighted every night in honour of the deity. The roofs are generally
sloping and made of thatch, unlike the majority of houses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>in
the Deccan, which are almost always terraced or flat roofed. I have
been into one or two houses rather larger than those described, where I
found a buffalo or two, after the usual Canarese fashion. There is an
air of encampment about the village, which suggests a gipsy
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present day costume and personal adornments of the Lamb&#257;di
females have been variously described by different writers. By one, the
women are said to remind one of the Zingari of Wallachia and the Gitani
of Spain. &ldquo;Married women,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3406src" href="#xd21e3406" name=
"xd21e3406src">26</a> &ldquo;are distinguished from the unmarried in
that they wear their bangles between the elbow and shoulder, while the
unmarried have them between the elbow and wrist. Unmarried girls may
wear black bead necklets, which are taken off at marriage, at which
time they first assume the ravikkai or jacket. Matrons also use an
earring called guriki to distinguish them from widows or unmarried
girls.&rdquo; In the Mysore Census Report, 1901, it is noted that
&ldquo;the women wear a peculiar dress, consisting of a lunga or gown
of stout coarse print, a tartan petticoat, and a mantle often
elaborately embroidered, which also covers the head and upper part of
the body. The hair is worn in ringlets or plaits hanging down each side
of the face, and decorated with shells, and terminating in tassels. The
arms are profusely covered with trinkets and rings made of bones, brass
and other rude materials. The men&rsquo;s dress consists of a white or
red turband, and a pair of white breeches or knicker-bockers, reaching
a little below the knee, with a string of red silk tassels hanging by
the right side from the waistband.&rdquo; &ldquo;The men,&rdquo; Mr. F.
S. Mullaly writes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218"
name="pb218">218</a>]</span>&ldquo;are fine muscular fellows, capable
of enduring long and fatiguing marches. Their ordinary dress is the
dhoty with short trousers, and frequently gaudy turbans and caps, in
which they indulge on festive occasions. They also affect a
considerable amount of jewellery. The women are, as a rule, comely, and
above the average height of women of the country. Their costume is the
laigna (langa) or gown of Karwar cloth, red or green, with a quantity
of embroidery. The chola (choli) or bodice, with embroidery in the
front and on the shoulders, covers the bosom, and is tied by variegated
cords at the back, the ends of the cords being ornamented with cowries
and beads. A covering cloth of Karwar cloth, with embroidery, is
fastened in at the waist, and hangs at the side with a quantity of
tassels and strings of cowries. Their jewels are very numerous, and
include strings of beads of ten or twenty rows with a cowry as a
pendant, called the cheed, threaded on horse-hair, and a silver hasali
(necklace), a sign of marriage equivalent to the t&#257;li. Brass or
horn bracelets, ten to twelve in number, extending to the elbow on
either arm, with a guzera or piece of embroidered silk, one inch wide,
tied to the right wrist. Anklets of ivory (or bone) or horn are only
worn by married women. They are removed on the death of the husband.
Pachala or silk embroidery adorned with tassels and cowries is also
worn as an anklet by women. Their other jewels are mukaram or nose
ornament, a silver kania or pendant from the upper part of the ear
attached to a silver chain which hangs to the shoulder, and a profusion
of silver, brass, and lead rings. Their hair is, in the case of
unmarried women, unadorned, brought up and tied in a knot at the top of
the head. With married women it is fastened, in like manner,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>with a cowry or a brass button, and heavy
pendants or gujuris are fastened at the temples. This latter is an
essential sign of marriage, and its absence is a sign of widowhood.
Lamb&#257;di women, when carrying water, are fastidious in the
adornment of the pad, called gala, which is placed on their heads. They
cover it with cowries, and attach to it an embroidered cloth, called
ph&#363;lia, ornamented with tassels and cowries.&rdquo; I gather that
Lamb&#257;di women of the Lavidia and Kimavath septs do not wear
bracelets (chudo), because the man who went to bring them for the
marriage of a remote ancestor died. In describing the dress of the
Lamb&#257;di women, the Rev. G. N. Thomssen writes that &ldquo;the
s&#257;ri is thrown over the head as a hood, with a frontlet of coins
dangling over the forehead. This frontlet is removed in the case of
widows. At the ends of the tufts of hair at the ears, heavy ornaments
are tied or braided. Married women have a gold and silver coin at the
ends of these tufts, while widows remove them. But the dearest
possession of the women are large broad bracelets, made, some of wood,
and the large number of bone or ivory. Almost the whole arm is covered
with these ornaments. In case of the husband&rsquo;s death, the
bracelets on the upper arm are removed. They are kept in place by a
cotton bracelet, gorgeously made, the strings of which are ornamented
with the inevitable cowries. On the wrist broad heavy brass bracelets
with bells are worn, these being presents from the mother to her
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each thanda, Mr. Natesa Sastri writes, has &ldquo;a headman called
the N&#257;yaka, whose word is law, and whose office is hereditary.
Each settlement has also a priest, whose office is likewise
hereditary.&rdquo; According to Mr. H. A. Stuart, the thanda is named
after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>headman, and he adds, &ldquo;the head of the
gang appears to be regarded with great reverence, and credited with
supernatural powers. He is believed to rule the gang most rigorously,
and to have the power of life and death over its members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the marriage ceremonies of the Sug&#257;lis of North
Arcot, Mr. Stuart informs us that these &ldquo;last for three days. On
the first an intoxicating beverage compounded of bhang (<i>Cannabis
indica</i>) leaves, jaggery (crude sugar), and other things, is mixed
and drunk. When all are merry, the bridegroom&rsquo;s parents bring Rs.
35 and four bullocks to those of the bride, and, after presenting them,
the bridegroom is allowed to tie a square silver bottu or t&#257;li
(marriage badge) to the bride&rsquo;s neck, and the marriage is
complete; but the next two days must be spent in drinking and feasting.
At the conclusion of the third day, the bride is arrayed in gay new
clothes, and goes to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, driving a bullock
before her. Upon the birth of the first male child, a second silver
bottu is tied to the mother&rsquo;s neck, and a third when a second son
is born. When a third is added to the family, the three bottus are
welded together, after which no additions are made.&rdquo; Of the
Lamb&#257;di marriage ceremony in the Bellary district, the following
detailed account is given by Mr. Francis. &ldquo;As acted before me by
a number of both sexes of the caste, it runs as follows. The bridegroom
arrives at night at the bride&rsquo;s house with a cloth covering his
head, and an elaborately embroidered bag containing betel and nut slung
from his shoulder. Outside the house, at the four corners of a square,
are arranged four piles of earthen pots&mdash;five pots in each. Within
this square two grain-pounding pestles are stuck upright in the ground.
The bride is decked with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=
"#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>cloth peculiar to married women,
and taken outside the house to meet the bridegroom. Both stand within
the square of pots, and round their shoulders is tied a cloth, in which
the officiating Br&#257;hman knots a rupee. This Br&#257;hman, it may
be at once noted, has little more to do with the ceremony beyond
ejaculating at intervals &lsquo;Sh&#333;bhana! Sh&#333;bhana!&rsquo; or
&lsquo;May it prosper!&rsquo; Then the right hands of the couple are
joined, and they walk seven times round each of the upright pestles,
while the women chant the following song, one line being sung for each
journey round the pestle:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">To yourself and myself marriage has taken place.</p>
<p class="line">Together we will walk round the marriage pole.</p>
<p class="line">Walk the third time; marriage has taken place.</p>
<p class="line">You are mine by marriage.</p>
<p class="line">Walk the fifth time; marriage has taken place.</p>
<p class="line">Walk the sixth time; marriage has taken place.</p>
<p class="line">Walk the seventh time; marriage has taken place.</p>
<p class="line">We have walked seven times; I am yours.</p>
<p class="line">Walk the seventh time; you are mine.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The couple then sit on a blanket on the ground
near one of the pestles, and are completely covered with a cloth. The
bride gives the groom seven little balls compounded of rice, ghee
(clarified butter) and sugar, which he eats. He then gives her seven
others, which she in turn eats. The process is repeated near the other
pestle. The women keep on chanting all the while. Then the pair go into
the house, and the cloth into which the rupee was knotted is untied,
and the ceremonies for that night are over. Next day the couple are
bathed separately, and feasting takes place. That evening the
girl&rsquo;s mother or near female relations tie to the locks on each
side of her temples the curious badges, called gugri, which distinguish
a married from an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222"
name="pb222">222</a>]</span>unmarried woman, fasten a bunch of tassels
to her back hair, and girdle her with a tasselled waistband, from which
is suspended a little bag, into which the bridegroom puts five rupees.
These last two are donned thereafter on great occasions, but are not
worn every day. The next day the girl is taken home by her new
husband.&rdquo; It is noted in the Mysore Census Report, 1891, that
&ldquo;one unique custom, distinguishing the Lamb&#257;ni marriage
ceremonial, is that the officiating Br&#257;hman priest is the only
individual of the masculine persuasion who is permitted to be present.
Immediately after the betrothal, the females surround and pinch the
priest on all sides, repeating all the time songs in their mixed
Kutn&#299; dialect. The vicarious punishment to which the solitary male
Br&#257;hman is thus subjected is said to be apt retribution for the
cruel conduct, according to a mythological legend, of a Br&#257;hman
parent who heartlessly abandoned his two daughters in the jungle, as
they had attained puberty before marriage. The pinching episode is
notoriously a painful reality. It is said, however, that the
Br&#257;hman, willingly undergoes the operation in consideration of the
fees paid for the rite.&rdquo; The treatment of the Br&#257;hman as
acted before me by Lamb&#257;di women at Nandy&#257;l, included an
attempt to strip him stark naked. In the Census Report, it is stated
that, at L&#257;mbadi weddings, the women &ldquo;weep and cry aloud,
and the bride and bridegroom pour milk into an ant-hill, and offer the
snake which lives therein cocoanuts, flowers, and so on. Br&#257;hmans
are sometimes engaged to celebrate weddings, and, failing a
Br&#257;hman, a youth of the tribe will put on the thread, and perform
the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following variant of the marriage ceremonies was acted before me
at Kad&#363;r in Mysore. A pandal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"
href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>(booth) is erected, and
beneath it two pestles or rice-pounders are set up. At the four
corners, a row of five pots is placed, and the pots are covered with
leafy twigs of <i>Calotropis procera</i>, which are tied with
<i>Calotropis</i> fibre or cotton thread. Sometimes a pestle is set up
near each row of pots. The bridal couple seat themselves near the
pestles, and the ends of their cloths, with a silver coin in them, are
tied together. They are then smeared with turmeric, and, after a
wave-offering to ward off the evil eye, they go seven times round the
pestles, while the women sing:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Oh! girl, walk along, walk.</p>
<p class="line">You boasted that you would not marry.</p>
<p class="line">Now you are married.</p>
<p class="line">Walk, girl, walk on.</p>
<p class="line">There is no good in your boasting.</p>
<p class="line">You have eaten the pudding.</p>
<p class="line">Walk, girl, walk.</p>
<p class="line">Leave off boasting.</p>
<p class="line">You sat on the plank with the bridegroom&rsquo;s thigh
on yours.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The bride and bridegroom take their seats on a plank,
and the former throws a string round the neck of the latter, and ties
seven knots in it. The bridegroom then does the same to the bride. The
knots are untied. Cloths are then placed over the backs of the couple,
and a swastika mark (<img src="images/swastika.png" alt="[swastika]"
width="27" height="27">) is drawn on them with turmeric paste. A
Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit is then brought to the pandal, and seats
himself on a plank. A clean white cloth is placed on his head, and
fastened tightly with string. Into this improvised turban, leafy twigs
of mango and <i>Cassia auriculata</i> are stuck. Some of the
Lamb&#257;di women present, while chanting a tune, throw sticks of
<i>Ficus glomerata</i>, <i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>, and mango in
front of the Br&#257;hman, pour gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) oil over
them, and set them on fire. The Br&#257;hman is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>made
a bridegroom, and he must give out the name of his bride. He is then
slapped on the cheeks by the women, thrown down, and his clothing
stripped off. The Br&#257;hman ceremonial concluded, a woman puts the
badges of marriage on the bride. On the following day, she is dressed
up, and made to stand on a bullock, and keep on crooning a mournful
song, which makes her cry eventually. As she repeats the song, she
waves her arms, and folds them over her head. The words of the song,
the reproduction of which in my phonograph invariably made the women
weep, are somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Oh! father, you brought me up so carefully by spending
much money.</p>
<p class="line">All this was to no purpose.</p>
<p class="line">Oh! mother, the time has come when I have to leave
you.</p>
<p class="line">Is it to send me away that you nourished me?</p>
<p class="line">Oh! how can I live away from you,</p>
<p class="line">My brothers and sisters?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Among the Lamb&#257;dis of Mysore, widow remarriage
and polygamy are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3513src" href=
"#xd21e3513" name="xd21e3513src">27</a> to freely prevail, &ldquo;and
it is customary for divorced women to marry again during the lifetime
of the husband under the s&#299;r&#275; udik&#275; (tying of a new
cloth) form of remarriage, which also obtains among the Vakkaligas and
others. In such cases, the second husband, under the award of the caste
arbitration, is made to pay a certain sum (tera) as amends to the first
husband, accompanied by a caste dinner. The woman is then readmitted
into society. But certain disabilities are attached to widow
remarriage. Widows remarried are forbidden entry into a regular
marriage party, whilst their offspring are disabled from legal marriage
for three generations, although allowed to take <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>wives from families similarly
circumstanced.&rdquo; According to Mr. Stuart, the Sug&#257;lis of the
North Arcot district &ldquo;do not allow the marriage of widows, but on
payment of Rs. 15 and three buffaloes to her family, who take charge of
her children, a widow may be taken by any man as a concubine, and her
children are considered legitimate. Even during her husband&rsquo;s
life, a woman may desert him for any one else, the latter paying the
husband the cost of the original marriage ceremony. The Sug&#257;lis
burn the married, but bury all others, and have no ceremonies after
death for the rest of the soul of the deceased.&rdquo; If the head of a
burning corpse falls off the pyre, the Lamb&#257;dis pluck some grass
or leaves, which they put in their mouths &ldquo;like goats,&rdquo; and
run home.</p>
<p>A custom called Valli Sukkeri is recorded by the Rev. G. N.
Thomssen, according to which &ldquo;if an elder brother marries and
dies without offspring, the younger brother must marry the widow, and
raise up children, such children being regarded as those of the
deceased elder brother. If, however, the elder brother dies leaving
offspring, and the younger brother wishes to marry the widow, he must
give fifteen rupees and three oxen to his brother&rsquo;s children.
Then he may marry the widow.&rdquo; The custom here referred to is said
to be practiced because the Lamb&#257;di&rsquo;s ancestor Sugr&#299;va
married his elder brother Vali&rsquo;s widow.</p>
<p>I am informed by Mr. F. A. Hamilton that, among the Lamb&#257;dis of
Kollegal in the Coimbatore district, &ldquo;if a widower remarries, he
may go through the ordinary marriage ceremony, or the kuttuvali rite,
in which all that is necessary is to declare his selection of a bride
to four or five castemen, whom he feeds. A widow may remarry according
to the same rite, her new husband <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"
href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>paying the expenses of the
feast. Married people are burnt. Unmarried, and those who have been
married by the kuttuvali rite, are buried. When cremation is resorted
to, the eldest son sets fire to the funeral pyre. On the third day he
makes a heap of the ashes, on which he sprinkles milk. He and his
relations then return home, and hold a feast. When a corpse is buried,
no such ceremonies are performed. Both males and females are addicted
to heavy drinking. Arrack is their favourite beverage, and a
Lamb&#257;di&rsquo;s boast is that he spent so much on drink on such
and such an occasion. The women dance and sing songs in eulogy of their
goddess. At bed-time they strip off all their clothes, and use them as
a pillow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lamb&#257;dis are said to purchase children from other castes,
and bring them up as their own. Such children are not allowed to marry
into the superior Lamb&#257;di section called Thanda. The adopted
children are classified as Koris, and a Kori may only marry a
Lamb&#257;di after several generations.</p>
<p>Concerning the religion of the Lamb&#257;dis, it is noted in the
Mysore Census Report, 1891, that they are &ldquo;Vishnuvaits, and their
principal object of worship is Krishna. Bana Sankari, the goddess of
forests, is also worshipped, and they pay homage to Basava on grounds
dissimilar to those professed by the Lingayets. Basava is revered by
the Lamb&#257;dis because Krishna had tended cattle in his incarnation.
The writer interviewed the chief Lamb&#257;ni priests domiciled in the
Holalker&#275; taluk. The priests belong to the same race, but are much
less disreputable than the generality of their compatriots. It is said
that they periodically offer sacrificial oblations in the agni or fire,
at which a mantram is repeated, which may be paraphrased thus:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I adore Bharma (Bramha) in the roots;</p>
<p class="line">Vishnu who is the trunk;</p>
<p class="line">Rudra (Mahad&#275;v) pervading the branches;</p>
<p class="line">And the D&#275;v&#257;s in every leaf.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The likening of the Creator&rsquo;s omnipotence
to a tree among a people so far impervious to the traditions of
Sanskrit lore may not appear very strange to those who will call to
mind the Scandinavian tree of Igdrasil so graphically described by
Carlyle, and the all-pervading Asvat&rsquo;tha (p&#299;pal) tree of the
Bhagavatg&#299;ta.&rdquo; It is added in the Mysore Census Report,
1901, that &ldquo;the Lamb&#257;nis own the Gosayis (Gosw&#257;mi) as
their priests or gurus. These are the genealogists of the
Lamb&#257;nis, as the Helavas are of the S&#299;vachars.&rdquo; Of the
Sug&#257;lis of Pungan&#363;r and Palman&#275;r in the North Arcot
district Mr. Stuart writes that &ldquo;all worship the Tirupati
Sw&#257;mi, and also two Saktis called K&#333;sa Sakti and M&#257;ni
Sakti. Some three hundred years ago, they say that there was a feud
between the Bukia and M&#363;du Sug&#257;lis, and in a combat many were
killed on both sides; but the widows of only two of the men who died
were willing to perform s&#257;ti, in consequence of which they have
been deified, and are now worshipped as saktis by all the
divisions.&rdquo; It is said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3543src" href=
"#xd21e3543" name="xd21e3543src">28</a> that, near Rolla in the
Anantapur district, there is a small community of priests to the
Lamb&#257;dis who call themselves Muhammadans, but cannot intermarry
with others of the faith, and that in the south-west of Madakas&#299;ra
taluk there is another sub-division, called the Mondu Tulukar (who are
usually stone-cutters and live in hamlets by themselves), who similarly
cannot marry with other Musalmans. It is noted by the Rev. J.
Cain<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3546src" href="#xd21e3546" name=
"xd21e3546src">29</a> that in some places the Lamb&#257;dis
&ldquo;fasten small rags torn from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228"
href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>some old garment to a bush in
honour of Kampalamma (kampa, a thicket). On the side of one of the
roads from Bastar are several large heaps of stones, which they have
piled up in honour of the goddess Guttalamma. Every Lamb&#257;di who
passes the heaps is bound to place one stone on the heap, and to make a
salaam to it.&rdquo; The goddess of the Lamb&#257;dis of Kollegal is,
according to Mr. Hamilton, Satthi. A silver image of a female, seated
tailor-fashion, is kept by the head of the family, and is an heirloom.
At times of festival it is set up and worshipped. Cooked food is placed
before it, and a feast, with much arrack drinking, singing, beating of
tom-tom, and dancing through the small hours of the night, is held.
Examples of the Lamb&#257;di songs relating to incidents in the
R&#257;m&#257;yana, in honour of the goddesses Durga and Bhav&#257;ni,
etc., have been published by Mr. F. Fawcett.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3551src" href="#xd21e3551" name="xd21e3551src">30</a></p>
<p>The Brinj&#257;ris are described by the Rev. G. Gloyer as carrying
their principal goddess &ldquo;Bonjairini Mata,&rdquo; on the horns of
their cattle (leitochsen).</p>
<p>It is noted by the Rev. G. N. Thomssen that the Lamb&#257;dis
&ldquo;worship the Supreme Being in a very pathetic manner. A stake,
either a carved stick, or a peg, or a knife, is planted on the ground,
and men and women form a circle round this, and a wild, weird chant is
sung, while all bend very low to the earth. They all keep on circling
about the stake, swinging their arms in despair, clasping them in
prayer, and at last raising them in the air. Their whole cry is
symbolic of the child crying in the night, the child crying for the
light. If there are very many gathered together for worship, the men
form one circle, and the women another. Another <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>peculiar custom is their sacrifice of a goat or
a chicken in case of removal from one part of the jungle to another,
when sickness has come. They hope to escape death by leaving one
camping ground for another. Half-way between the old and new grounds, a
chicken or goat is buried alive, the head being allowed to be above
ground. Then all the cattle are driven over the buried creature, and
the whole camp walk over the buried victim.&rdquo; In former days, the
Lamb&#257;dis are reputed to have offered up human sacrifices.
&ldquo;When,&rdquo; the Abb&eacute; Dubois writes, &ldquo;they wish to
perform this horrible act, it is said, they secretly carry off the
first person they meet. Having conducted the victim to some lonely
spot, they dig a hole, in which they bury him up to the neck. While he
is still alive, they make a sort of lump of dough made of flour, which
they place on his head. This they fill with oil, and light four wicks
in it. Having done this, the men and women join hands, and, forming a
circle, dance round their victim, singing and making a great noise,
till he expires.&rdquo; The interesting fact is recorded by Mr. Mullaly
&ldquo;that, before the Lamb&#257;dis proceed on a predatory excursion,
a token, usually a leaf, is secreted in some hidden place before
proceeding to invoke Durga. The Durgamma p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest), one
of their own class, who wears the sacred thread, and is invested with
his sacred office by reason of his powers of divination, lights a fire,
and, calling on the goddess for aid, treads the fire out, and names the
token hidden by the party. His word is considered an oracle, and the
p&#363;j&#257;ri points out the direction the party is to
take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a further note on the religion of the Lamb&#257;dis, I gather
that they worship the following:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Balaji, whose temple is at Tirupati. Offerings of money are
made to this deity for the bestowal of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>children, etc. When
their prayers are answered, the Lamb&#257;dis walk all the way to
Tirupati, and will not travel thither by railway.</li>
<li>(2) Hanum&#257;n, the monkey god.</li>
<li>(3) Poleramma. To ward off devils and evil spirits.</li>
<li>(4) Mallalamma. To confer freedom to their cattle from attacks of
tigers and other wild beasts.</li>
<li>(5) Ankalamma. To protect them from epidemic disease.</li>
<li>(6) Peddamma.</li>
<li>(7) Maremma.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Lamb&#257;dis observe the Holi festival, for the celebration of
which money is collected in towns and villages. On the Holi day, the
headman and his wife fast, and worship two images of mud, representing
Kama (the Indian cupid) and his wife Rati. On the following morning,
cooked food is offered to the images, which are then burnt. Men and
women sing and dance, in separate groups, round the burning fire. On
the third day, they again sing and dance, and dress themselves in gala
attire. The men snatch the food which has been prepared by the women,
and run away amid protests from the women, who sometimes chastise
them.</p>
<p>It is narrated by Moor<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3585src" href=
"#xd21e3585" name="xd21e3585src">31</a> that &ldquo;he passed a tree,
on which were hanging several hundred bells. This was a superstitious
sacrifice by the Bandjanahs, who, passing this tree, are in the habit
of hanging a bell or bells upon it, which they take from the necks of
their sick cattle, expecting to leave behind them the complaint also.
Our servants particularly cautioned us against touching these
diabolical bells; but, as a few were taken for our own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>cattle, several accidents that happened were
imputed to the anger of the deity, to whom these offerings were made,
who, they say, inflicts the same disorder on the unhappy bullock who
carries a bell from this tree as he relieved the donor from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a legend in connection with the matsya gundam (fish pool)
close under the Yendrika hill in the Vizagapatam district. The fish
therein are very tame, and are protected by the M&#257;dgole Zamindars.
&ldquo;Once, goes the story, a Brinj&#257;ri caught one and turned it
into curry, whereon the king of the fish solemnly cursed him, and he
and all his pack-bullocks were turned into rocks, which may be seen
there to this day.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3592src" href=
"#xd21e3592" name="xd21e3592src">32</a></p>
<p>Lamb&#257;di women often have elaborate tattooed patterns on the
backs of the hands, and a tattooed dot on the left side of the nose may
be accepted as a distinguishing character of the tribe in some parts.
My assistant once pointed out that, in a group of Lamb&#257;dis, some
of the girls did not look like members of the tribe. This roused the
anger of an old woman, who said &ldquo;You can see the tattoo marks on
the nose, so they must be Lamb&#257;dis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lamb&#257;di women will not drink water from running streams or big
tanks.</p>
<p>In the Mysore Province, there is a class of people called
Thamb&#363;ri, who dress like Lamb&#257;dis, but do not intermarry with
them. They are Muhammadans, and their children are circumcised. Their
marriages are carried out according to the Muhammadan nikka rite, but
they also go through the Lamb&#257;di form of marriage, except that
marriage pots are not placed in the pandal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>(wedding booth). The Lamb&#257;dis apparently
pay some respect to them, and give them money at marriages or on other
occasions. They seem to be bards and panegyrists of the Lamb&#257;dis,
in the same way that other classes have their N&#333;kkans,
V&#299;ramushtis, Bhatr&#257;zus, etc. It is noted by Mr.
Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3603src" href="#xd21e3603" name=
"xd21e3603src">33</a> that the Lamb&#257;dis have priests called Bhats,
to whom it is probable that the Thamb&#363;ris correspond in
Mysore.</p>
<p>The methods of the criminal Lamb&#257;dis are dealt with at length
by Mr. Mullaly. And it must suffice for the present purpose to note
that they commit dacoities and have their receivers of stolen property,
and that the Naik or headman of the gang takes an active share in the
commission of crime.</p>

Ling&#257;yats, Mr. R. C. C. Carr records that the Linga Banjigs or
Banajigas are essentially traders, though many are now cultivators, and
that Telugu Ling&#257;yats often call themselves Linga Balijas.</p>
<p>The following legendary account of the origin of the &ldquo;Linga
Bhojunnalawaru&rdquo; is given in the Baramahal Records.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3641src" href="#xd21e3641" name=
"xd21e3641src">34</a> &ldquo;Para Brahma or the great god Brahma
created the god Pralayakala Rudra or the terrific at the day of
destruction, a character of the god Siva, and he created the Chatur
Acharyulu or four sages named Panditaraju, Yekcoramalu, Murralaradulu,
and Somaluradulu, and taught them mantras or prayers, and made them his
deputies. On a time, the Asuras and Devatas, or the giants and the
gods, made war on each other, and the god Pralayakala Rudra produced
from his nose a being whom he named Muchari Rudra, and he had five
sons, with whom he went to the assistance of the devatas or gods, and
enabled them to defeat the giants, and for his service the gods
conferred upon him and his sons the following honorary
distinctions:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>A flag with the figure of an alligator (crocodile) portrayed on
it.</li>
<li>A flag with the figure of a fish portrayed on it.</li>
<li>A flag with the figure of a bullock.</li>
<li>A flag with the figure of an eagle.</li>
<li>A flag with the figure of a bell.</li>

<li>The use of tents.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=

<p>&ldquo;On a time, when the god Pralayakala Rudra and Mochari Rudra
and his five sons, with other celestial attendants, were assembled on
the Kail&#257;sa parvata or mountain of Paradise, the god directed the
latter to descend into the Bhuloka or earthly world, and increase and
multiply these species. They humbly prayed to know how they were again
to reach the divine presence. He answered &lsquo;I shall manifest
myself in the Bhuloka under the form of the Lingam or Priapus; do you
worship me under that form, and you will again be permitted to approach
me.&rsquo; They accordingly descended into the earthly regions, and
from them the present castes of Baljawaras deduce their
origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Linga Balijas of the North Arcot district, Mr. H.
A. Stuart writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3669src" href="#xd21e3669"
name="xd21e3669src">35</a> that &ldquo;Linga Balija appears rather to
be the name of the followers of a religious faith than of a distinct
caste, for the Linga Balijas state that their caste contains eleven
sub-divisions, each with a separate occupation, viz., Jangam (priests),
Reddi (cultivators), G&#257;ndla (oil-mongers), and the like. Almost
all the Linga Balijas of North Arcot are traders, who speak Canarese
and are immigrants from Mysore, in which their gurus (religious
preceptors) live, and whither they still refer their caste disputes. At
one time they enjoyed much importance in this district, particularly in
its large trading towns. Headmen among them, styled Chettis, were by
the Arcot Naw&#257;bs assigned districts, in which they possessed both
magisterial and civil authority, and levied taxes from other merchants
for their own personal use. They carried on very extensive trade with
Mysore and the Ceded districts, and are said to have had enormous
warehouses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>which they enclosed and fortified. Breaches of
the peace are also described as not infrequent, resulting from the
interference of one Linga Balija Chetti with matters relating to the
district of another. Their authority has long since disappeared, and is
only a matter of tradition. Every Linga Balija wears a Siva lingam,
usually encased in a silver casket (or gold casket set with precious
stones), and suspended from the neck, but the very poor place theirs in
a cloth, and sometimes tie it to their arm. It is a strict rule that
one should be tied to a child&rsquo;s neck on the tenth day of its
birth, otherwise it is not entitled to be classed as a Linga Balija.
The Siva lingam worn by these people differs from the B&#363;ta or
Pr&#275;ta lingams used by Pand&#257;rams, Kaik&#333;lans, or others
who profess the Ling&#257;yat faith. They acknowledge two
pur&#257;nams, called respectively the Siva and Basava pur&#257;nams,
and differ in very many respects from other Hindus. They bury and do
not burn their dead, and do not recognise the five kinds of pollution
resulting from a birth, death, spittle, etc., and they do not therefore
bathe in order to remove such pollution. Widow remarriage is allowed
even where the widow has children, but these are handed over to the
relatives of her first husband. To widow remarriages no women who are
not widows are admitted, and, similarly, when a maiden is married, all
widows are excluded. Unlike most Hindus, Linga Balijas shave off the
whole of the hair of their heads, without leaving the usual lock at the
back. They deny metempsychosis, and believe that after death the soul
is united with the divine spirit. They are particular in some of their
customs, disallowing liquor and flesh-eating, and invariably eating
privately, where none can see them. They decline even to eat in the
house of a Br&#257;hman.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"

<p>A Linga Banajiga (Canarese trader), whom I interviewed at
Sand&#363;r, was smeared with white marks on the forehead, upper
extremities, chest, and abdomen in imitation of a Hubli priest. Some
orthodox Ling&#257;yat traders remove their lingam during the
transaction of the day&rsquo;s work, on the ground, as given to me,
that it is necessary to tell little falsehoods in the course of
business.</p>
<p><b>Lingad&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;A general term, meaning one who wears a
lingam, for Ling&#257;yat.</p>
<p><b>Lingakatti.</b>&mdash;A name applied to Ling&#257;yat Badagas of
the N&#299;lgiri hills.</p>
<p><b>Lingam.</b>&mdash;A title of Jangams and S&#299;lavants.</p>
<p><b>Ling&#257;yat.</b>&mdash;For the following note I am mainly
indebted to Mr. R. C. C. Carr, who took great interest in its
preparation when he was Collector of Bellary. Some additional
information was supplied by Mr. R. E. Enthoven, Superintendent of the
Ethnographic Survey, Bombay. The word Ling&#257;yat is the anglicised
form of Lingavant, which is the vernacular term commonly used for any
member of the community. The Ling&#257;yats have been aptly described
as a peaceable race of Hindu Puritans. Their religion is a simple one.
They acknowledge only one God, Siva, and reject the other two persons
of the Hindu Triad, They reverence the V&#275;das, but disregard the
later commentaries on which the Br&#257;hmans rely. Their faith
purports to be the primitive Hindu faith, cleared of all priestly
mysticism. They deny the supremacy of Br&#257;hmans, and pretend to be
free from caste distinctions, though at the present day caste is in
fact observed amongst them. They declare that there is no need for
sacrifices, penances, pilgrimages or fasts. The cardinal principle of
the faith is an unquestioning belief in the efficacy of the lingam, the
image which has always been regarded as symbolical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>of
the God Siva. This image, which is called the jangama lingam or
moveable lingam, to distinguish it from the sthavara or fixed lingam of
Hindu temples, is always carried on some part of the body, usually the
neck or the left arm, and is placed in the left hand of the deceased
when the body is committed to the grave Men and women, old and young,
rich and poor, all alike wear this symbol of their faith, and its loss
is regarded as spiritual death, though in practice the loser can after
a few ceremonies, be invested with a new one. They are strict
disciplinarians in the matter of food and drink, and no true
Ling&#257;yat is permitted to touch meat in any form, or to partake of
any kind of liquor. This Puritan simplicity raises them in the social
scale, and has resulted in producing a steady law-abiding race, who are
conservative of the customs of their forefathers and have hitherto
opposed a fairly unbroken front to the advancing tide of foreign ideas.
To this tendency is due the very slow spread of modern education
amongst them, while, on the other hand, their isolation from outside
influence has without doubt assisted largely in preserving intact their
beautiful, highly polished, and powerful language, Canarese.</p>
<p>It is matter of debate whether the Ling&#257;yat religion is an
innovation or a revival of the most ancient Saivaite faith, but the
story of the so-called founder of the sect, Basava, may with some
limitations be accepted as history. The events therein narrated
occurred in the latter half of the twelfth century at Kaly&#257;n, a
city which was then the capital of the Western Ch&#257;lukyas, and is
now included in the province of Bidar in the Niz&#257;m&rsquo;s
Dominions. It lies about a hundred miles to the west of Hyderabad. The
Ch&#257;lukyas came originally from the north of India, but appeared to
the south of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>Nerbudda as early as the fourth century.
They separated into two branches during the seventh century, and the
western line was still represented at Kaly&#257;n 500 years later. The
southern portion of Hindustan had for centuries been split up between
rival kingdoms, and had been the theatre of the long struggle between
the Buddhists, the Jains, and the Hindus. At the time of Basava&rsquo;s
appearance, a Jain king, Bijjala by name, was in power at Kaly&#257;n.
He was a representative of the Kalachuryas, a race which had been
conquered by the Ch&#257;lukyas, and occupied the position of
feudatories. Bijjala appears to have been the Commander-in-chief of the
Ch&#257;lukyan forces, and to have usurped the throne, ousting his
royal master, Taila III. The date of the usurpation was 1156 A.D.,
though, according to some accounts, Bijjala did not assume the full
titles till some years later. He was succeeded by his sons, but the
Ch&#257;lukyan claimant recovered his throne in 1182, only to lose it
again some seven years afterwards, when the kingdom itself was divided
between the neighbouring powers. The final downfall of the
Ch&#257;lukyan Deccani kingdom was probably due to the rise of the
Ling&#257;yat religion. The Hindus ousted the Jains, but the tenets
inculcated by Basava had caused a serious split in the ranks of the
former. The house divided against itself could not stand, and the
Ch&#257;lukyas were absorbed into the kingdoms of their younger
neighbours, the Hoysala Ballalas from Mysore in the south, and the
Y&#257;davas from D&#275;vagiri (now identified with Daulatabad) in the
north.</p>
<p>At about this time there appears to have been a great revival of the
worship of Siva in the Deccan and in Southern India. A large number of
important Saivaite temples are known to have been built during
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and
inscriptions speak of many learned and holy men who were devoted to
this worship. The movement was probably accentuated by the opposition
of the Jains, who seem to have been very powerful in the Western
Deccan, and in Mysore. An inscription which will be more fully noticed
later on tells of the God Siva specially creating a man in order to
&ldquo;put a stop to the hostile observances of the Jains and
Buddhists.&rdquo; This was written about the year 1200 A.D., and it may
be gathered that Buddhism was still recognised in the Deccan as a
religious power. Mr. Rice tells us that the labours of the Saivaite
Br&#257;hman, Sankar&#257;ch&#257;rya, had in the eighth century dealt
a deathblow to Buddhism, and raised the Saiva faith to the first
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3704src" href="#xd21e3704" name=
"xd21e3704src">36</a> Its position was, however, challenged by the
Jains, and, even as late as the twelfth century, it was still battling
with them. The Vaishnavaite reformer,
R&#257;m&#257;nuj&#257;ch&#257;rya, appeared at about this time, and,
according to Mr. Rice, was mainly instrumental in ousting Jainism; but
the followers of Vishnu built many of their big temples in the
thirteenth century, two hundred years later than their Saivaite
brethren, so it may be presumed that the latter faith was in the
ascendancy prior to that time. Chaitanya, the Vaishnavaite counterpart
of Basava, appeared at a much later date (1485 A.D.). It is interesting
to note that the thirteenth century is regarded as the culminating
period of the middle ages in Italy, when religious fervour also
displayed itself in the building of great cathedrals.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3707src" href="#xd21e3707" name="xd21e3707src">37</a></p>
<p>The actual date of Basava&rsquo;s birth is uncertain, but is given
by some authorities as 1106 A.D. The story of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>his
career is told in the sacred writings of the Ling&#257;yats, of which
the principal books are known as the Basava Pur&#257;na and the
Channabasava Pur&#257;na. The former was apparently finished during the
fourteenth century, and the latter was not written till 1585. The
accounts are, therefore, entirely traditionary, and, as might have been
expected, are full of miraculous occurrences, which mar their
historical value. The Jain version of the story is given in the
Bijjalar&#257;yacharitra, and differs in many particulars. The main
facts accepted by Ling&#257;yat tradition are given by Dr. Fleet in the
Epigraphia Indica [Vol. V, p. 239] from which the following account is
extracted. To a certain Madiraja and his wife Madal&#257;mbika, pious
Saivas of the Br&#257;hman caste, and residents of a place called
Bagev&#257;di, which is usually supposed to be the sub-divisional town
of that name in the Bijapur district, there was born a son who, being
an incarnation of Siva&rsquo;s bull, Nandi, sent to earth to revive the
declining Saiva rites, was named Basava. This word is the Canarese
equivalent for a bull, an animal sacred to Siva. When the usual time of
investiture arrived, Basava, then eight years of age, having meanwhile
acquired much knowledge of the Siva scriptures, refused to be invested
with the sacred Br&#257;hmanical thread, declaring himself a special
worshipper of Siva, and stating that he had come to destroy the
distinctions of caste. This refusal, coupled with his singular wisdom
and piety, attracted the notice of his uncle Balad&#275;va, prime
minister of the Kalachurya king Bijjala, who had come to be present at
the ceremony; and Balad&#275;va gave him his daughter, Gang&#257;devi
or Gang&#257;mba, in marriage. The Br&#257;hmans, however, began to
persecute Basava on account of the novel practices propounded by him,
and he consequently left his native town and went to a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>village named Kappadi, where he spent his early
years, receiving instruction from the God Siva. Meanwhile his uncle
Balad&#275;va died, and Bijjala resolved to secure the services of
Basava, whose ability and virtues had now become publicly known. After
some demur Basava accepted the post, in the hope that the influence
attached to it would help him in propagating his peculiar tenets. And,
accompanied by his elder sister, N&#257;gal&#257;mbika, he proceeded to
Kaly&#257;na, where he was welcomed with deference by the king and
installed as prime minister, commander-in-chief and treasurer, second
in power to the king himself; and the king, in order to bind him as
closely as possible to himself, gave him his younger sister Nilalochana
to wife. Somewhere about this time, from Basava&rsquo;s unmarried
sister N&#257;gal&#257;mbika there was born, by the working of the
spirit of Siva, a son who was an incarnation of Siva&rsquo;s son
Shanmukha, the god of war. The story says that Basava was worshipping
in the holy mountain and was praying for some gift, when he saw an ant
emerge from the ground with a small seed in its mouth. Basava took this
seed home, and his sister without Basava&rsquo;s knowledge swallowed
it, and became pregnant. The child was called Channabasava, or the
beautiful Basava, and assisted his uncle in spreading the new
doctrines. Indeed, he is depicted as playing a more important part than
even Basava himself.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3717width" id="pl4-240"><img src=
"images/pl4-240.jpg" alt="Linga Banajiga with lingam on head." width=
"515" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Linga Banajiga with lingam on head.</p>
</div>
<p>The two Pur&#257;nas are occupied for the most part with doctrinal
expositions, recitals of mythology, praises of previous Siva saints,
and accounts of miracles worked by Basava. They assert, however, that
uncle and nephew were very energetic promoters of the faith, and that
they preached the persecution and extermination of all persons
(especially the Jains), whose creed differed from that of the
Ling&#257;yats. Coupled with the lavish <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>expenditure incurred
by Basava from the public coffers in support of Jangams or
Ling&#257;yat priests, these proceedings aroused in Bijjala, himself a
Jain, feelings of distrust, which were fanned by a rival minister,
Manchanna, although the latter was himself a V&#299;ra Saiva, and at
length an event occurred which ended in the assassination of Bijjala
and the death of Basava.</p>
<p>At Kaly&#257;na there were two specially pious Ling&#257;yats, whom
Bijjala in mere wantonness caused to be blinded. Thereupon Basava left
Kaly&#257;na, and deputed one of his followers Jagaddeva to slay the
king. Jagaddeva, with two others, succeeded in forcing his way into the
palace, where he stabbed the king in the midst of his court. Basava
meanwhile reached Kudali-Sangameshvara, and was there absorbed into the
lingam, while Channabasava fled to Ulvi in North Canara, where he found
refuge in a cave.</p>
<p>The above story is taken mainly from the Basava Pur&#257;na. The
account given in the Channabasava Pur&#257;na differs in various
details, and declares that Bijjala was assassinated under the orders of
Channabasava, who had succeeded his uncle in office. The Jain account
states that Basava&rsquo;s influence with the king was due to
Basava&rsquo;s sister, whom Bijjala took as a concubine. The death of
Bijjala was caused by poisoned fruit sent by Basava, who, to escape the
vengeance of Bijjala&rsquo;s son, threw himself into a well and died.
The version of Basava&rsquo;s story, which is found in most books of
reference, makes him appear at Kaly&#257;n as a youth flying from the
persecution of his father. His uncle, Balad&#275;va, sheltered him and
eventually gave him his daughter; and, when Balad&#275;va died, Basava
succeeded to his office. This seems to have been copied from the
account given by Mr. C. P. Brown, but later translations of the
Pur&#257;na show that it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>erroneous. When Basava came to
Kaly&#257;n, Bijjala was in power, and his arrival must therefore have
been subsequent to 1156 A. D. If the date of birth be accepted as 1106,
Basava would have been a man of fifty years of age or more when
summoned to office by Bijjala. The latter resigned in favour of his son
in 1167, and may have been assassinated shortly afterwards. On the
other hand, Balad&#275;va could not have been Bijjala&rsquo;s minister
when he came to Basava&rsquo;s upan&#257;yanam ceremony, for this event
occurred in 1114, long before the commencement of Bijjala&rsquo;s
reign. There is no reason, however, for crediting the Pur&#257;na with
any great historical accuracy, and, in fact, the evidence now coming to
light from inscriptions, which the industry of arch&aelig;ologists is
giving to the world, throws great doubt upon the traditional
narrative.</p>

<p>An inscription on stone tablets which have now been built into the
wall of a modern temple at Managoli, a village in the Bij&#257;pur
district of the Bombay Presidency about eleven miles to the north-west
of B&#257;gev&#257;di, the supposed birth place of Basava, contains a
record of the time of the Kalachuri king, Bijjala. Two dates are given
in the inscription, and from one of them it is calculated with
certainty that Bijjala&rsquo;s reign began in 1156 A.D. The record
gives a certain date as &ldquo;the sixth of the years of the glorious
Kalachurya Bijjalad&#275;va, an emperor by the strength of his arm, the
sole hero of the three worlds.&rdquo; The corresponding English date is
Tuesday, 12th September, 1161 A.D., so that Bijjala must have come into
power, by the strength of his arm, in 1156. But a still more important
piece of information is furnished by the mention of a certain Basava or
Basavarasayya as the builder of the temple, in which the inscription
was first placed, and of one Madir&#257;ja, who held the post of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>Mahaprabhu of the village when the grants in
support of the temple were made. The record runs as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3740src" href="#xd21e3740" name=
"xd21e3740src">38</a> &ldquo;Among the five hundred of Manigavalli
there sprang up a certain Govardhana, the moon of the ocean that was
the Kasyappa <span class="corr" id="xd21e3743" title=
"Source: gotra">g&#333;tra</span>, an excellent member of the race of
the Vajins. His son was Revad&#257;sa. The latter had four sons.... The
youngest of these became the greatest, and, under the name of
Chandramas, made his reputation reach even as far as the Himalaya
mountains. To that lord there was born a son, Basava. There were none
who were like him in devotion to the feet of (the God) Maheshvara
(Siva); and this Basava attained the fame of being esteemed the sun
that caused to bloom the water-lily that was the affection of the five
hundred Br&#257;hmans of Manigavalli. This Basavarasayya came to be
considered the father of the world, since the whole world, putting
their hands to their foreheads, saluted him with the words &lsquo;our
virtuous father&rsquo;; and thus he brought greatness to the famous
Manigavalli, manifesting the height of graciousness in saying this is
the abode of the essence of the three V&#275;das; this is the
accomplishment of that which has no end and no beginning; this is the
lustrous divine linga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Fleet suggests that we have at last met with an epigraphic
mention of the Ling&#257;yat founder, Basava. This is eminently
satisfactory, but is somewhat upsetting, for the inscription makes
Basava a member of the Kasyapa g&#333;tra, while Madir&#257;ja is
placed in an entirely different family. As regards the latter, the
record says; (<i>l.</i> 20) &ldquo;in the lineage of that lord (Taila
II, the leader of the Chalukyas) there was a certain Madhava, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>Prabhu of the town of Manigavalli, the very
Vishnu of the renowned Harita g&#333;tra;&rdquo; and later on the same
person is spoken of as the Mahaprabhu Madir&#257;ja. If Basava and
Madir&#257;ja, herein mentioned, are really the heroes of the
Ling&#257;yats, it is clear that they were not father and son, as
stated in the Ling&#257;yat writings. But it must be borne in mind that
this is the only inscription yet deciphered which contains any allusion
whatever to Basava, and the statement that &ldquo;he caused to bloom
the water-lily that was the affection of the five hundred Br&#257;hmans
of Manigavalli,&rdquo; is directly opposed to the theory that he broke
away from the Br&#257;hman fold, and set up a religion, of which one of
the main features is a disregard of Br&#257;hman supremacy. The fact
that the inscription was found so near to Basava&rsquo;s birthplace is,
however, strong evidence in favour of the presumption that it refers to
the Basava of Ling&#257;yat tradition, and the wording itself is very
suggestive of the same idea. The record gives a long pedigree to
introduce the Basava whom it proceeds to extol, and puts into his mouth
the noteworthy utterance, which ascribes godly qualities to the
&ldquo;lustrous divine linga.&rdquo; The date of this record is
contemporary with the events and persons named therein, and it must
therefore be far more reliable than the traditionary stories given in
the Pur&#257;nas, which, as already indicated, are not at all in
accordance with each other. Dr. Fleet is of opinion that the
Pur&#257;na versions are little better than legends. This is perhaps
going too far, but there can be no doubt that later research will in
this, as in the case of all traditionary history, bring to knowledge
facts which will require a considerable rearrangement of the long
accepted picture.</p>
<p>Another inscription, discovered at Abl&#363;r in the Dharwar
district of the Bombay Presidency, is of great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>importance in this connection. It is dated about
A.D. 1200, and mentions the Western Chalukya king Somesvara IV, and his
predecessor the Kalachurya prince Bijjala. It narrates the doings of a
certain Ek&#257;ntada R&#257;mayya, so called because he was an ardent
and exclusive worshipper of Siva. This individual got into controversy
with the Jains, who were apparently very powerful at Abl&#363;r, and
the latter agreed to destroy their Jina and to set up Siva instead, if
R&#257;mayya would cut off his own head before his god, and have it
restored to his body after seven days without a scar. R&#257;mayya
appears to have won his wager, but the Jains refused to perform their
part of the contract. The dispute was then referred to king Bijjala,
himself a Jain, and R&#257;mayya was given a jayapatra, or certificate
of success. This king and his Chalukyan successor also presented
R&#257;mayya with lands in support of certain Siva temples. It is
noteworthy that the story is told also in the Channabasava Pur&#257;na,
but the controversy is narrated as having occurred at Kaly&#257;n,
where R&#257;mayya had gone to see king Bijjala. The same passage makes
R&#257;mayya quote an instance of a previous saint, Mah&#257;l&#257;ka,
having performed the same feat at a village named Jambar, which may
conceivably be the Abl&#363;r of the inscription. But the interest and
importance of the inscription centre in the fact that it discloses the
name of another devout and exclusive worshipper of Siva, who, it is
said, caused this man to be born into the world with the express object
of &ldquo;putting a stop to the hostile observances of the Jains and
the Buddhists who had become furious&rdquo; or aggressive. Dr. Fleet
considers that, making allowance for the supernatural agency introduced
into the story, the narrative is reasonable and plain, and has the ring
of truth in it; and, in his opinion, it shows us the real person to
whom the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>revival of the ancient Saivaite faith was due.
The exploits of R&#257;mayya are placed shortly before A.D. 1162, in
which year Bijjala is said to have completed his usurpation of the
sovereignty by assuming the paramount titles. R&#257;mayya was thus a
contemporary of Basava, but the Abl&#363;r inscription makes no mention
of the latter.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3760width" id="pl4-247"><img src=
"images/pl4-247.jpg" alt="Ling&#257;yat." width="496" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Ling&#257;yat.</p>
</div>
<p>This fresh evidence does not appear to run counter to the commonly
accepted story of the origin of the Ling&#257;yats. It confirms the
theory that the religion of Siva received a great impetus at this
period, but there is nothing in the inscription ascribing to
R&#257;mayya the position of a reformer of Saivaite doctrines. He
appears as the champion of Siva against the rival creeds, not as the
Saivaite Luther who is attacking the priestly mysticism of the Saivaite
divines; and, as Dr. Fleet points out, there is nothing improbable in
the mention of several persons as helping on the same movement. Both
R&#257;mayya and Basava are, however, represented in these inscriptions
as being the chief of Saivaite Br&#257;hmans, and there is no mention
of any schism such as the Protestant revolt which is associated with
the name of Luther. It is possible, therefore, that the establishment
of the Ling&#257;yat sect may have been brought about by the followers
of these two great men&mdash;a fact that is hinted at in Ling&#257;yat
tradition by the very name of Channabasava, which means Basava the
beautiful, because, according to the Channabasava Pur&#257;na, he was
more beautiful in many respects than Basava, who is represented as
receiving instruction from his superior nephew in important points
connected with their faith. The two inscriptions and numerous others,
which have been deciphered by the same authority, are of the greatest
value from a historical point of view, and paint in bold <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>colours the chief actors in the drama. The
closing years of the Western Chalukyan kingdom are given to us by the
hand of an actor who was on the same stage, and, if the birth of the
Ling&#257;yat creed is still obscured in the mist of the past, the
figures of those who witnessed it stand out with surprising
clearness.</p>
<p>It has been already stated that one of the principles of the
religion is a disregard of caste distinctions. The prevailing races
were Dravidian, and it is an accepted fact that the theory of caste as
propounded by Manu is altogether foreign to Dravidian ideas. Historians
cannot tell us how long the process of grafting the caste system on to
the Dravidian tree lasted, but it is clear that, when Basava appeared,
the united growth was well established. Br&#257;hmans were acknowledged
as the leaders in religious matters, and, as the secular is closely
interwoven with the religious in all eastern countries, the priestly
class was gradually usurping to itself a position of general control.
But, as was the case in Europe during the sixteenth century, a movement
was on foot to replace the authority of the priests by something more
in accordance with the growing intelligence of the laity. And, as in
Europe, the reformers were found amongst the priests themselves. Luther
and Erasmus were monks, who had been trained to support the very system
of priestcraft, which they afterwards demolished. Basava and
R&#257;mayya, as already stated, were Saivaite Br&#257;hmans, from whom
has sprung a race of free thinkers, who affect the disregard of caste
and many of the ceremonial observances created by the Br&#257;hman
priesthood. The comparison may even be carried further. Luther was an
iconoclast, who worked upon men&rsquo;s passions, while Erasmus was a
philosopher, who addressed himself to their intellects. Basava,
according to the traditionary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249"
href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>account, was the counterpart
of Luther. R&#257;mayya may be fairly called the Indian Erasmus.</p>
<p>This freedom from the narrowing influence of caste was doubtless a
great incentive to the spread of the reformed religion. The lingam was
to be regarded as the universal leveller, rendering all its wearers
equal in the eye of the Deity. High and low were to be brought together
by its influence, and all caste distinctions were to be swept away.
According to Basava&rsquo;s teaching, all men are holy in proportion as
they are temples of the great spirit; by birth all are equal; men are
not superior to women, and the gentle sex must be treated with all
respect and delicacy; marriage in childhood is wrong, and the
contracting parties are to be allowed a voice in the matter of their
union; and widows are to be allowed to remarry. All the iron fetters of
Br&#257;hmanical tyranny are, in fact, torn asunder, and the
Ling&#257;yat is to be allowed that freedom of individual action, which
is found amongst the more advanced Christian communities. Even the
lowest castes are to be raised to the level of all others by the
investiture of the lingam, and all Lingadh&#257;ris, or wearers of the
divine symbol, are to eat together, to intermarry, and to live at
unity.</p>
<p>But social distinctions inevitably asserted themselves later. As the
Ling&#257;yats, or Panchams&#257;lis as they styled themselves,
increased in importance, number and wealth, elaborate forms of worship
and ceremony were introduced, rules of conduct were framed, and a
religious system was devised, on which the influence of the rival
Br&#257;hman aristocracy can be freely traced. Thus, in course of time,
the Panchams&#257;lis became a closed caste, new converts were placed
on a lower social footing, the priests alone continuing as a privileged
class to dine freely with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=
"#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>them. This development is alleged
to have occurred about the close of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Among the many ceremonies introduced in the course of the changes
just described, one known as the ashtavarna or eight-fold protection is
of special importance.</p>

</ul>
<p>Among the greater number of Ling&#257;yats, after the birth of a
child, the parents send for the guru or spiritual adviser of the
family, who is the representative of one of the five Ach&#257;ryas from
whom the father claims descent, or in his absence of his local agent.
The guru binds the linga on the child, besmears it with vibh&#363;ti
(ashes), places a garland of rudr&#257;ksha (fruits of
<i>El&aelig;ocarpus Ganitrus</i>) round its neck, and teaches it the
mystic mantra of &ldquo;Namah Shivaya.&rdquo; The child being incapable
of acquiring the knowledge of the sacred text at this early stage of
its existence, the mantra is merely recited in its ear by the guru. The
child has then to be presented to the god Siva in the person of a
Jangam, or Ling&#257;yat priest, who is summoned for the purpose; on
his arrival, the parents wash his feet. The water in which the feet are
washed is described as the <span class="corr" id="xd21e3825" title=
"Source: tirtha">t&#299;rtha</span> or charana t&#299;rtha of Siva.
This <span class="corr" id="xd21e3828" title=
"Source: tirtha">t&#299;rtha</span> is next poured over the linga
attached to the infant. The Jangam is fed, and a portion of the cooked
food from the dish is placed in the child&rsquo;s mouth. This final
ceremony is known as pras&#257;da. (I am informed that it would be
considered by Tamil Ling&#257;yats sacrilege to wash the lingam with
the <span class="corr" id="xd21e3831" title=
"Source: tirtha">t&#299;rtha</span>.) Occasionally the double character
of guru and Jangam are combined in one person. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to some accounts, the rites described above form the basis
of the present social organization of the Ling&#257;yat community. They
are divided into those entitled to ashtavarna, and those who are not.
The first of these divisions is again sub-divided into several groups,
which may for convenience be designated Panchams&#257;lis who are
descendants of the original converts, and non-Panchams&#257;lis or
later converts.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3838width" id="pl4-251"><img src=
"images/pl4-251.jpg" alt="Linga Banajiga." width="509" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Linga Banajiga.</p>
</div>
<p>This explanation will throw some light on the scheme of
classification adopted in the Bombay Gazetteer (<i>see</i> volumes
Bijapur and Dharwar) where the smaller groups are shown as&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>1.</span> Pure Ling&#257;yats.</li>
<li><span>2.</span> Affiliated Ling&#257;yats.</li>
<li><span>3.</span> Half Ling&#257;yats.</li>
</ul>
<p>These divisions, of which the full significance is not clearly
conveyed by the titles, may perhaps be expanded with advantage by the
addition to each of the alternatives already explained, viz.,
Panchams&#257;lis, non-Panchams&#257;lis with ashtavarna rites, and
others, including the unclean castes attached to the Ling&#257;yat
community by reason of performing its menial services, <i>e.g.</i>,
Dhors, Chalv&#257;dis, etc. It is the modern practice to deny to these
low castes the right to style themselves Ling&#257;yats at all. It must
be further explained that there are seven divisions of
Panchams&#257;lis, and that these stand to each other in the relation
of hypergamous groups, that is to say, members of the higher orders may
wed the daughters of those beneath them, which suggests the probable
former existence of free intermarriage. Members of the lower orders
among these Panchams&#257;lis may rise to the higher by performing
certain religious ceremonies, constituting a form of initiation. In the
second and third divisions, <i>i.e.</i>, non-Panchams&#257;lis and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>&ldquo;others,&rdquo; the sub-castes are
functional groups and are endogamous, <i>i.e.</i>, intermarriage is
prohibited. It seems probable that the members of these divisions
became converts to Ling&#257;yatism some time after the initiation of
the reforms, to which it gave birth, when the crusade against caste
distinctions had lost much of its pristine vigour, and ceased to be a
living part of the fundamental doctrine of the sect.</p>
<p>At the present day, marriage is both infant and adult, and the
parties to the contract have practically no choice. Widows are indeed
allowed to remarry, but such marriages are regarded with disfavour by
the stricter members of the sect. A Pariah or a M&#257;la cannot be
invested with the lingam, and, if he pretends to be a Ling&#257;yat,
the Jangam does not acknowledge him. The strict rules regarding meat
and drink are maintained, and Ling&#257;yats are still free from many
of the ceremonies and religious performances required of other Hindus.
But the tendency of to-day is to follow the lead of the Br&#257;hman;
and, while no Ling&#257;yat will admit the superiority of that caste,
they practically acknowledge it by imitating many Br&#257;hmanical
practices. Much of the good effected by the founder has thus been
counteracted, and the Ling&#257;yat is gradually becoming more and more
like his orthodox Hindu brother. In proof of this tendency it may be
noted that, at the time of the census of 1891, there were numerous
representations from Ling&#257;yats claiming the right to be described
as V&#299;rasaiva Br&#257;hmans. Further, on the occasion of the census
of 1901, a complete scheme was supplied to the census authorities
professing to show all Ling&#257;yat sub-divisions in four groups,
viz., Br&#257;hman, Kshatriya, Vaishya and S&#363;dra. It is noted, in
the Mysore Census Report, 1891, that the Ling&#257;yats interviewed the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>Mahar&#257;ja, and begged that their
registration as V&#299;rasaiva Br&#257;hmans might be directed.
&ldquo;The crisis was removed by His Highness the Mahar&#257;ja&rsquo;s
Government passing orders to the effect that the Ling&#257;yats should
not be classed as S&#257;dras any more than any other
non-Br&#257;hmans, but should be separately designated by their own
name, and that, while they were at liberty to call themselves
V&#299;rasaiva Br&#257;hmans, they should specify the name of the
particular and well-known sub-division to which each censused unit
belonged. It is noteworthy that, as soon as the clamour of the
Ling&#257;yats was set at rest, some of their leaders seem to have
become ashamed of their own previous vehemence, while the movement
seemed to have lost the spring imparted by sincerity. Their feelings
were brought to the test when the question of permitting the wonted
periodical procession of their religious flagstaff, the
nand&#299;-dhvaja, came on for consideration by the Police department.
The Ling&#257;yats&rsquo; application for a license was opposed by the
other castes on the ground that, since they had become Br&#257;hmans,
and had ceased to belong to the right-hand faction, they had no right
to parade the nand&#299;-dhvaja. The Ling&#257;yats then showed
themselves glad to regain their <i>status quo ante</i>.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>In connection with the name V&#299;rasaiva, it may be noted <i>en
passant</i> that the first session of the Shreemat Veerashaiva
Mahasabha<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3892src" href="#xd21e3892" name=
"xd21e3892src">39</a> was held at Dharwar in the Bombay Presidency in
1904. Thereat various suggestions were made concerning religious
instruction, education, marriage, the settlement of disputes by
arbitration, and other matters affecting the material welfare of the
Ling&#257;yat community as a whole. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is worthy of note that, according to some writers, Basava is
supposed to have come within the influence of the Syrian Christians.
The idea was started by Mr. C. P. Brown, whose essay on the
Jangams<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3898src" href="#xd21e3898" name=
"xd21e3898src">40</a> is the classic on this subject. Mr. A. C. Burnell
quotes the remarkable fact from Cosmos that, in the sixth century,
there was a Persian Bishop at Kalli&#257;na near Udupi. And it is
presumed by Surgeon-Major W. R. Cornish, the writer of the Madras
Census Report, 1871, that Kalli&#257;na is identical with Kaly&#257;n,
where Basava was prime minister six centuries later. This is clearly
wrong, for Udupi is on the west coast 30 miles north of Mangalore,
whereas Kaly&#257;n, the Chalukyan capital, is in the heart of the
Deccan, 350 miles away over the western ghauts. There was another
Calyaun or Kali&#257;na close to Udupi on the coast, as shown by some
of the older maps. But it is well known that Western India was at this
time tenanted by large settlements of Persians or Manich&aelig;ans, and
recent discoveries tend to show that these people were Christians. It
seems, therefore, to be quite possible that the discussions, which
preceded Basava&rsquo;s revolt, were tinged with some Christian
colouring, derived from the followers of the Syrian school. Mr. Burnell
even thinks that all the modern philosophical schools of India owe much
to the same source.</p>
<p>The Ling&#257;yat faith appears to have spread very rapidly after
Basava&rsquo;s death, which may be placed in the year 1168, and Rice
says that, according to tradition, within sixty years of the
founder&rsquo;s death it was embraced from Ulavi near Goa to
Shol&#257;pur, and from Balehalli to Sivaganga. The disappearance of
the Chalukyan dynasty is in itself evidence of the rising power of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>Ling&#257;yats. But no real estimate can be made
of its progress at first. More than a hundred years later, the
Muhammadan invaders took possession of the Deccan, and other religions
were driven southwards. The Empire of Vijayanagar, which is said to
have covered the whole country from the Kistna to Cape Comorin, rose
out of the ruins of the Hindu kingdoms, and as Mr. Sewell
says,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3905src" href="#xd21e3905" name=
"xd21e3905src">41</a> the fighting Kings of Vijayanagar became the
saviours of the south for two and a half centuries. The early members
of this dynasty were Saivaites in faith, but there is no record of the
workings of the reformed religion, which had spread southwards before
Vijayanagar became a power.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e3909width" id="pl4-255"><img src=
"images/pl4-255.jpg" alt="Jangam." width="491" height="720">
<p class="figureHead">Jangam.</p>
</div>
<p>The followers of this religion are easily distinguished from other
Hindus by the fact that the lingam is worn on a conspicuous part of the
body. The bulk of the cultivators enclose it in a red silk scarf tied
round their necks, with a knot in front. This scarf is tied on the left
arm above the elbow when the wearer is at work, and is sometimes placed
round the head when bathing. Some of the traders, who are the richer
class, carry it in a small silver box hung round the neck with a thread
called sivadh&#257;ra, or in a gold box studded with precious stones.
The women do not wear it outside the dress, and generally keep it on a
neck-string. No one is allowed to put it down even for a moment.
Recently a Ling&#257;yat merchant in Madras removed his silver lingam
casket from his neck, wrapped it up in a cloth, put it under his head,
and went to sleep on a street pial (platform). While he was slumbering,
the casket was stolen by a cart driver. The lingam itself, which is
regarded as the home of the deity, is generally made of grey
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>soapstone brought from Parvatgiri (Srisaila) in
the Kurnool district. It is brought by a class of people called Kambi
Jangams, because, besides the linga stone, they bring on a k&#257;vadi
or shoulder-bamboo the holy water of the P&#257;t&#257;lganga, a pool
on Parvatgiri, whose water Ling&#257;yats hold as sacred as
Br&#257;hmans the water of the Ganges.</p>
<p>The following description of the lingam is taken from the Bombay
Gazetteer for B&#299;japur. &ldquo;It consists of two discs, the lower
one circular about one-eighth of an inch thick, the upper slightly
elongated. Each disc is about three-quarters of an inch in diameter,
and is separated by a deep groove about an eighth of an inch broad.
From the centre of the upper disc, which is slightly rounded, rises a
pea-like knob about a quarter of an inch long and three-quarters of an
inch round, giving the stone lingam a total height of nearly
three-quarters of an inch. This knob is called the b&#257;n or arrow.
The upper disc is called jalh&#257;ri, that is the water carrier,
because this part of a full-sized lingam is grooved to carry off the
water which is poured over the central knob. It is also called
p&#299;ta, that is the seat, and p&#299;thak the little seat. Over the
lingam, to keep it from harm, is plastered a black mixture of clay,
cowdung ashes, and marking-nut juice. This coating, which is called
kauthi or the cover, entirely hides the shape of the enclosed lingam.
It forms a smooth black slightly truncated cone, not unlike a dark
betel nut, about three-quarters of an inch high, and narrowing from
three-quarters of an inch at the base to half an inch across the
top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jangam cannot as a rule be distinguished from other
Ling&#257;yats. All male members of the community have a clean-shaved
head, without the top-knot common to the Br&#257;hmans. All, male as
well as female, daub <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span>their foreheads with vibh&#363;ti or sacred
ashes every morning. There is thus no distinctive mark for the Jangam.
But certain ascetics of the priestly class sometimes put on a red robe
peculiar to them, and others cover themselves with vibh&#363;ti and
many quaint ornaments. [A Jangam whom I interviewed at a village in
Mysore, was named V&#299;rabhadra Kayaka, and was also known as
K&#257;si Lingada V&#299;ra. He was going about the village, shouting,
dancing, and repeating the V&#299;rabhadra khadga or praise of
V&#299;rabhadra, Siva&rsquo;s son. On his bead he had a lingam stuck in
his head-cloth, with a five-headed snake forming a canopy over it, and
the sacred bull Basava in front. Tied to the forehead, and passing
round the head, was a string holding thirty-two lingams. At the back of
the head was a mane of white false hair. His face was painted bright
red. Round the neck he had four garlands of rudr&#257;ksha beads, and
suspended from the neck, and resting on the chest, was a silver casket
containing a lingam. Round the waist was a waist-band made of brass
squares ornamented with a variety of figures, among which were the
heads of Daksha Brahma and V&#299;rabhadra. Suspended from the neck was
a breast-plate, with a representation of V&#299;rabhadra and the
figures of Daksha Brahma and his wife engraved in copper. From the
waist a piece of tiger skin was suspended, to which were attached two
heads of Daksha Brahma with a lion&rsquo;s head between. Hanging lower
down was a figure of Basava. Tied to the ankles were hollow brass
cylinders with loose bits of brass inside. Strings of round brass bells
were tied to the knees. In his right hand he carried a long sword, and
tied to the left forearm was a gauntlet-handled scimitar. To the handle
were attached pieces of brass, which made a noise when the arm was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>shaken. Finally, round the forearm were tied
pieces of bear-skin.]</p>

<p>No account of the Ling&#257;yat community as it exists at the
present day would be complete without some reference to the grounds on
which the modern representatives of Ling&#257;yatism claim for their
religion an origin as ancient as that of Br&#257;hministic Hinduism,
and a social structure similar to that which is described in the Code
of Manu.</p>
<p>Mr. Karibasava Sh&#257;stri, Professor of Sanskrit and Canarese in
the State College of Mysore, writes that the Shaiv sect of Hindus has
always been divided into two groups, the one comprising the wearers of
the linga, and the other those who do not wear it. The former he
designates V&#299;rshaiv, and declares that the V&#299;rshaivs consist
of Br&#257;hman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, S&#363;dra. Quoting from the 17th
chapter of the Parameshvar &#256;gma, he declares that the
V&#299;rshaiv Br&#257;hmans are also known as Shudha V&#299;rshaivs,
V&#299;rshaiv Kings are Marga V&#299;rshaiv, V&#299;rshaiv Vaishya are
Mishra V&#299;rshaiva, and the S&#363;dras of the community are Anter
V&#299;rshaiv. In his opinion the duties and penances imposed on the
first of these classes are&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) The ashtavarna.</li>
<li>(2) Penances and bodily emaciation.</li>
<li>(3) The worship of Siva without sacrifice.</li>
<li>(4) The recital of the V&#275;das.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Professor asserts that the Hindu ashrams of Br&#257;hmacharya,
Grahasta and Sany&#257;si are binding on V&#299;rshaivs, and quotes
from various Sanskrit works texts in support of this view. He also
furnishes a mythical account of the origin of the Ling&#257;yats at the
time of the creation of the world.</p>
<p>A committee of gentlemen appointed in the Belgaum district to
consider the question of the origin of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>the Ling&#257;yats
base their opinion on a Sanskrit work, the Paramarahasya, and give the
following account:&mdash;&ldquo;When the God Shiva wished to people the
earth, he created from his mouth five acharyas, namely, Marula
Radhyacharya, Ekoranadhyacharya, Revanaradhyacharya,
Panditaradhyacharya and Vishvaradhyacharya. These five acharyas
propagated the Ling&#257;yat portion of mankind. Each of them founded a
g&#333;tra, namely, Bhringi, V&#299;ra, Vrisha, Skanda and Handi, and
their five seats are Shrishaila, Kollipaki, Ujjaini, Kashi and
Balihalli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third account prepared specially in connection with the census of
1901 begins by controverting the common opinion that Basava founded the
Ling&#257;yat religion, that it was in origin anti-Br&#257;hmanical,
and that it abolished caste distinctions. The account continues as
follows. &ldquo;A little enquiry will clearly show that it was not
Basava who founded the religion, but that he only revived the
previously existing and ancient religion; that it is not
anti-Br&#257;hmanical, but that it protests against the efficacy of
animal sacrifices, and that the religion itself is founded on the
authority of the V&#275;das, treating of animal sacrifices just as the
Shri Vaishnav and M&#257;dhva religions have rejected certain portions
and adopted certain others of the V&#275;das. Consequently it is
incorrect to say that the V&#299;rshaivs reject the authority of the
V&#275;das.&rdquo; The writer maintains that caste distinctions are not
foreign to the nature of Ling&#257;yatism, and asserts that they have
always existed. According to him, the orthodox theory is that, when
Brahma was ordered to create the world, he requested Siva to teach him
how to, whereupon Siva created aprakruts. Brahma created the world from
the five elements of nature, and produced the prakruts. The
Ling&#257;yats are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260"
name="pb260">260</a>]</span>the aprakruts, and the Br&#257;hmanistic
Hindus prakruts. Here follow many quotations from Sanskrit &#256;gmas
in support of the facts alleged. It is unnecessary to weary the reader
with the texts and their translations. The object in referring to these
latter day accounts of the origin of the Ling&#257;yats is to show the
modern tendency of tradition to bring Ling&#257;yatism into line with
Br&#257;hmanistic Hinduism. The works referred to by the learned
authors appear to be Sanskrit writings of not more than 500 years ago,
and cannot be taken as proof that the Ling&#257;yat religion is of
greater antiquity than the 12th century, or that it has always been
observant of caste distinctions. The persistence with which these
points are advanced at the present day is, however, worthy of careful
notice. If Ling&#257;yatism was an island thrown up within the
&ldquo;boundless sea of Hinduism,&rdquo; it would appear that the
waters of the ocean are doing their utmost to undermine its solid
foundations. The Ling&#257;yats in Bombay, Madras and Mysore number
about two millions. Mysore and the Southern Mahratta country are the
principal homes of the creed, and the Bellary district, which is wedged
in between the above territories, must be classed with them. Mr. Rice
tells us that it was the State religion of the Wodeyars of Mysore from
1399 to 1610, and of the N&#257;yaks of Keladi, Ikkeri or Bednur from
1550 to 1763. At the present day the ruling family in Mysore employ
none but Ling&#257;yats as cooks and watermen. The Ling&#257;yats of
Madras numbered 138,518 at the census of 1901. These figures, however,
are of doubtful accuracy, as many were entered under caste names, and
the probable strength of the community must be largely in excess of the
figures. They were chiefly found in the Bellary district. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>The following are the main sub-divisions of the community in the
Madras Presidency :&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">1. Jangam. The priestly class.</p>
<p>2. Banajiga or Banjig, divided into Banajigas proper and Jain
Banajigas.</p>
<p>These are essentially traders, but many are now cultivators. The
equivalent in the Telugu country is Linga Balija. Jangams occasionally
take Banajiga girls in marriage. The girl has to undergo certain
ceremonies before her marriage, and after that she should not be
treated as a daughter or sister of the family, but should be considered
as a Jangam&rsquo;s wife, and respect paid to her. Jangam girls are not
given to Banajigas as wives. Jain Banajigas are considered as inferior
to Banajigas proper, and girls of the former are not married into
families of the latter.</p>
<p>3. Sadaru, divided into Kumbala Kudi Sadaru and Chadaru Sadaru. The
great majority are cultivators.</p>
<p>4. Laligonda, divided into Hera (elder) and Chikka (younger)
Laligonda.</p>
<p>5. K&#257;pu, R&#275;ddi, and Vakkal&#299;ga, cultivators.</p>
</div>
<p>The Ar&#257;dhya Br&#257;hman is termed a Ling&#257;yat. This caste
is not included in the present note. The members of it wear the sacred
thread, as well as the lingam. They are strict Saivite Br&#257;hmans,
and have nothing to do with the Ling&#257;yats proper.</p>
<p>The three religious divisions of the community are
styled:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">1. Nirabara V&#299;ra Saiva. Sany&#257;sis or
ascetics, wearing only the kaupinam or loin-cloth</p>
<p>2. Vishesha V&#299;ra Saiva. The priestly class, generally called
Jangams.</p>
<p>3. S&#257;m&#257;nya V&#299;ra Saiva. This includes all
Ling&#257;yats, who are not Sany&#257;sis or Jangams. The whole
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>Ling&#257;yat community is dealt with by Mr. C.
P. Brown under the name Jangam, and his essay speaks of Vishesha and
S&#257;m&#257;nya Jangams. This is incorrect, for no S&#257;m&#257;nya
V&#299;ra Saiva can be a Jangam, and all Jangams are Vishesha V&#299;ra
Saivas.</p>
</div>
<p>The Jangams are mostly literate, and the members of the Banjig or
trader class are frequently literate. The other classes of men, and the
women of all classes are practically illiterate. Canarese is the common
language of Ling&#257;yats, and it is usually preserved as a house
language where Canarese is not the language of the locality. In Bellary
the teachers in several of the board schools (primary standard) are
Jangams. Very few Ling&#257;yats have as yet competed for University
honours, and the number of Ling&#257;yat graduates is small.</p>
<p>The common termination for males is Appa, and for females Amma or
Akka, or Avva. In the case of Jangams the male termination is Ayya. The
names commonly in use are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Basappa or Basamma, after Basava, the founder of the
religion.</p>
<p>Chennappa or Chennava, after Chennabasava, nephew of Basava.</p>
<p>Sugurappa or Suguravva, after Sugur, where there is a temple of
V&#299;rabhadra.</p>
<p>Revanna or Revamma, after Revana Sideswara, the founder of the
Balehalli mutt.</p>
<p>Mallappa or Mallava, a localised name of Siva.</p>
<p>N&#257;gappa or N&#257;ganna, after a snake.</p>
<p>Bussappa or Bussavva, after the hiss of a snake.</p>
</div>
<p>Basappa is the most common name of all, and it is said that in
Kott&#363;r, a town of 7,000 inhabitants, not far from Ujjini, one half
of the male Ling&#257;yats are styled Kott&#363;r Basappa. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>Tinduga or Tind&#333;di is a nickname given to a daughter&rsquo;s
son born and bred up in his maternal grandfather&rsquo;s house. The
name signifies that the boy will some day quit the house and join his
father&rsquo;s family, tindu meaning eating, and wodi, running away. If
the child happens to be a female she is called Tindavva or
Tind&#333;di. Kuldappa, or Kuldavva, is a nickname for one who fails to
see a thing at once when he looks for it. Kulda is a corruption of
kuruda, which means a blind man. Superstition has something to do with
the naming of children. Children whose predecessors died successively
in their infancy are named as Sudugappa or Sudug&#257;davva after
sudug&#257;du, burial-ground, Gundappa or Gundavva after gundu, a rock,
Tippiah or Tippavva after tippa, a rubbish heap, Tirakappa after
tirakambonu, begging. These names signify humility, and are given in
the belief that God will pity the parents and give the children a long
lease of life. Two names are not given to a child, but pet names are
used instead.</p>
<p>The recognised head-quarters of the Ling&#257;yats in the Bellary
district is Ujjini, a village in the south of the Kudligi t&#257;luk on
the borders of Mysore. There are five head-quarters of the community in
different parts of India. In each there is what is called a
Simhasanadh&#299;pati. In the first period of creation, &#298;swara or
Siva is supposed to have appeared in five different forms, emanating
from his five faces, and the five Ling&#257;yat centres are
representative of these five forms. The places are Ujjini,
Sr&#299;saila, Koll&#275;p&#257;ka, Balehalli, and Benares.</p>
<p>It is said that the Mutt at Koll&#275;p&#257;ka no longer exists,
and has been replaced by one at Bukkasagar in the Hospet t&#257;luk of
Bellary district. The shape and materials of their dwellings are not in
any way different from those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>of other Hindus. In the Bellary
district, houses of the better classes are built of stone; poorer
persons can only afford mud houses. All adopt the flat roof peculiar to
the Deccan.</p>

<p>It is recorded, in the Mysore Census Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the
orthodox theory among the Ling&#257;yats is that their religion was
founded by a number of Ach&#257;ryas, the most famous of whom were
Renuka, Daraka, Gajakarna, Ghantakarna and Viswakarna, who are the
Gotrakartas of the Ling&#257;yat Dwijas, having received their mandate
direct from Siva to establish his true religion on earth, or rather to
restore it to its purity. As belonging to the Apprakrita Srishti, the
V&#299;rasaivas are enjoined not to follow that portion of the
V&#275;das which treats of Yagnas or animal sacrifices. Their
contention is that karma, or the performance of ceremonies, is of two
kinds, namely, one relating to the attainment of worldly desires, and
the other relating to the attainment of wisdom or gnana. The idea of
salvation in Br&#257;hmanical religions generally is the attainment of
desires, going to Swarga or Heaven, where one would enjoy eternal
bliss. But salvation, as understood by the V&#299;rasaiva religion, is
something different, and goes one step further, meaning absorption into
and attainment of oneness with the deity. Consequently, they are
prohibited from performing all those ceremonies which relate to the
attainment of Swarga, but are bound to perform those which relate to
gnana or wisdom, and to salvation as understood by them. The five great
Gotrakartas established five great religious centres in different parts
of India, viz., Ekorama at Ketara in the Himalayas, Viswacharya at
Benares, Marutacharya at Ujjain, Pandithacharya at Sr&#299;saila in
Cuddapah district, and Renuk&#257;ch&#257;rya at Balehalli or
Balehonn&#363;r in Koppa t&#257;luk (of Mysore), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>at
all of which places the mutts still exist. The heads of these mutts
have geographically divided the Ling&#257;yats into five great
divisions, and each head exercises spiritual control within his own
legitimate sphere, though all of them have a general jurisdiction over
all the Ling&#257;yats generally. Each of these mutts, called
simhasanas (thrones), has sub-mutts in important popular centres under
the management of Pattadasw&#257;mis. Each sub-mutt has a number of
branch mutts, called Gurusthala mutts, under it, and these latter are
established wherever a community of Ling&#257;yats exists. The rights
and duties of the Sw&#257;mis of these mutts are to preside on all
ceremonial occasions, to receive their dues, to impart religious
instructions, to settle religious disputes, and to exercise a general
control over all matters affecting the interests of the community at
large. But one particular feature of this sect is the existence of
another order of priests, called Viraktas, also known as Nirabharis or
Jangamas, who hold the highest position in the ecclesiastical order,
and therefore command the highest respect from laymen as well as from
the above mentioned clergy. Each Virakta mutt is directly subject to
the Murgi mutt at Chitaldrug, which has absolute jurisdiction over all
the Viraktas. Most Ling&#257;yat towns have a Virakta mutt built
outside the town, where the Sw&#257;mi or the Jangama leads a solitary,
simple and spiritual life. Unlike the other priests, the Virakta is
prohibited from presiding on ceremonial occasions, and from receiving
unnecessary alms unless for the purpose of immediately distributing the
same to others. He should devote his whole life partly to spiritual
meditation, and partly to the spreading of spiritual knowledge among
his disciples, so that he would be the fountain head, to whom all
laymen and all clergy must turn for spiritual wisdom. His position,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>in short, should be that of a pure Sany&#257;si
of the most exalted order. But here, as in the case of most other
Indian ecclesiastical orders, the modern representative of the ancient
prototype is far different from the ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sacrifices are contrary to the tenets of the faith, but the
practices of other Hindus are to some extent copied. When laying the
foundations of a house, a cocoanut is broken, incense offered and
camphor burnt. When setting up the main door frame, a ceremony called
Dw&#257;ra Pratishta is performed. On that day, or a subsequent day, an
iron nail is driven into the frame, to prevent devils or evil spirits
from entering the house. After the house is completed, the ceremony of
Graha Prav&#275;sam takes place. With all Ling&#257;yat ceremonies the
most important feature is the worship of the jangam, and in this
instance the house is sprinkled with water, in which the Jangam&rsquo;s
feet have been washed. Jangam&rsquo;s friends and relatives are then
entertained and fed in the house.</p>
<p>Theoretically, any one may become a Ling&#257;yat by virtue of
investiture with the lingam. But in practice very few outsiders are
admitted. The priests do not proselytise. The elders of the community
sometimes persuade a relative or friend to join the fold. In the
Bellary district, it is believed that the religion is not spreading.
The contrary seems to be the case in the Bombay Presidency. The Bijapur
Gazetteer states that the wearing of the lingam, and the desertion of
Br&#257;hmans for Jangams as priests, are still spreading among the
Br&#257;hmanical castes of Bijapur, and adds &ldquo;In Mr.
Cumine&rsquo;s opinion few castes have remained beyond the influence of
the new sect, and between Ling&#257;yatism and Islam, Br&#257;hmanism
will in a few centuries be almost extinct.&rdquo; According to Mr. C.
P. Brown, the Jangams <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href=
"#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>insist upon any candidate for
admission undergoing a probation of ten or twelve years. The
authorities at Ujjini state that there is a recognised scale of
probation ranging from three years for the Br&#257;hman to twelve years
for the S&#363;dra, but the Jangams admit that no Br&#257;hmans are
ever converted now, and the probation period is probably not enforced.
The castes from which outsiders occasionally come are the various
sub-divisions of the K&#257;pu or Reddi caste. It is not uncommon to
find all the Neredi K&#257;pus in one village wearing the lingam, while
the people of the same caste in a neighbouring village are not
Ling&#257;yats. The Pakan&#257;ti K&#257;pus illustrate the same rule.
Ling&#257;yat and non-Ling&#257;yat K&#257;pus who are relatives eat
together, and in some cases intermarry.</p>
<p>Ling&#257;yatism has recently made converts from other castes. In
the last century, many weavers of Tuminkatti in the Dharwar district of
Bombay were converted by a Jangam from Ujjini, and are now known as
Kurvinav&#257;ru. They have abandoned all social intercourse with the
parent caste.</p>
<p>According to Basava&rsquo;s teaching, even the lowest castes could
join the community, and obtain equality with other Lingay&#257;ts. The
Abb&eacute; Dubois wrote that, &ldquo;even if a Pariah joins the sect,
he is considered in no way inferior to a Br&#257;hman. Wherever the
lingam is found, there they say is the throne of the deity, without
distinction of class or rank. The Pariah&rsquo;s humble hut containing
the sacred emblem is far above the most magnificent palace where it is
not.&rdquo; These were undoubtedly the views of the founder, but his
orders are not followed at the present day. The authorities at Ujjini
deny that any M&#257;la or M&#257;diga can become a Ling&#257;yat, and
say that, even if he wears a lingam, it has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>not
been given him by a Jangam. There is a class of M&#257;las called
Chalav&#257;dis, whose duty it is to accompany Ling&#257;yat
processions, and ring a bell. These Chalav&#257;dis wear the lingam. It
is, however, the accepted rule amongst Ling&#257;yats of the present
day that a M&#257;la or M&#257;diga cannot wear lingam.</p>
<p>In a note on the relations between Ling&#257;yats and
Br&#257;hmans,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4043src" href="#xd21e4043"
name="xd21e4043src">42</a> Mr. T. V. Subramanyam refers to the
long-standing differences between them in the Bellary district.
&ldquo;The quarrel,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;has reference to the
paraphernalia the former may carry in their religious processions, and
has its origin in a legend. The story runs that Vedavyasa, the author
of the Mah&#257;bharata and a fervent devotee of Vishnu, once went to
Benares with the object of establishing the superiority of his
favourite deity in that stronghold of Saivism. Within the precincts of
the temple, he raised his hands aloft, proclaiming that Vishnu was the
supreme God, when, to the consternation of the assembled worshippers,
Nandi, the trusted servant and vehicle of Siva, whose sculptured image
is found in every temple sacred to his master, rose up in indignation,
and cut off the right hand of the blasphemous sage. The principal
insignia claimed to be used in Ling&#257;yat processions are
makaratoranam, pagaladivitti, svetachhatram, nandidhvajam, and
vyasahastam. No objection is raised by the Br&#257;hmans to the use of
the first three of these, which are respectively a banner with the
representation of a tortoise embroidered thereon, torches carried
during the day, and a white umbrella. The nandidhvajam consists of a
long pole, at the upper end of which floats a flag with a
representation of Nandi, and to which is affixed an image of Basava,
the founder of the sect. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>vyasahastam is a similar pole,
from which a wooden arm is suspended. The assertion of the prowess of
Nandi, and the perpetuation of the punishment alleged by the
Ling&#257;yats to have been inflicted on Vyasa for daring to declare
the supremacy of Vishnu, as symbolised by these emblems, are equally
offensive to all classes of Br&#257;hmans, as the sage is reverenced
equally by Vaishnavas, M&#257;dhvas, and Smartas. Besides these
emblems, the Ling&#257;yats claim that, during their processions, they
are entitled to ring a bell, which is usually suspended from the flat
end of a large ladle-like object. The Br&#257;hmans object to this,
however, as the bells are carried by low-caste persons, who ring them
with their feet, to the accompaniment of chants intended to insult the
Br&#257;hmans and their religious creeds. They contend also that the
hollow of the ladle is designed in mockery of the Brahmakapala (or
skull of Brahma), which is very sacred in their eyes.... In the year
1811, a dispute arose regarding the display of the nandidhavajam and
the vyasahastam, an enquiry into which was held by the Judge of
Bellary, who issued a proclamation for general information throughout
the district, prohibiting the procession altogether, and declaring that
no person should attempt it, on pain of being put in irons, and sent to
take his trial before the Court of Circuit.... When the Sringeri
Sw&#257;mi, known as Jagadguru or spiritual head of the universe,
visited Bellary in 1888, certain Ling&#257;yats petitioned the District
Magistrate, praying that, if he was to be allowed to enter the town
displaying his usual paraphernalia, their gurus must also be allowed a
similar privilege during their processions. The petitioners were
directed to meet the agent of the Sringeri Sw&#257;mi, and they agreed
with him, to quote from the Collector&rsquo;s order, in a spirit of
mutual consideration that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href=
"#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>the processions of the gurus of
the Smarta Br&#257;hmans and of the Ling&#257;yats should be peaceably
conducted, and that, in the latter, neither the nandidhvajam nor the
vyasahastam should be used. In 1899, it was decided in a Civil Court
that the bells used in the processions of the Ling&#257;yats should be
rung with the hands and not with the feet, and that the
Chalav&#257;dis, or bell-ringers, should not utter any cries or chants
offensive to the feelings of the Br&#257;hmans. In 1901, the Collector
negotiated a compromise between the Ling&#257;yats and the
Br&#257;hmans of Rayadr&#363;g, by which the display of all insignia,
except the vyasahastam, was permitted to the former. Apparently, the
Br&#257;hmans have not been satisfied with the terms of this
compromise, as, subsequent to 1901, they have started civil litigation,
in which it is contended that the use of nandidhvajam is itself
objectionable. At the present moment, therefore, the Br&#257;hman
Ling&#257;yat controversy is exactly where it was a hundred years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Non-Ling&#257;yats, wishing to join the faith, have to undergo a
three days&rsquo; purification ceremony. On the first day they get
their face and head shaved, and take a bath in cow&rsquo;s urine and
ordure. Except these articles, they are under a prohibition to drink or
eat anything else that day. On the second day they bathe themselves in
dhulodaka, <i>i.e.</i>, water with which a Jangam&rsquo;s feet have
been washed, and eat sugar and drink cow&rsquo;s milk. On the third or
last day, they take a panchamrutham bath, <i>i.e.</i>, they apply to
the head and body a paste made of plantains, cow&rsquo;s milk, gh&#299;
(clarified butter), curds and honey, and wash it off with water; they
drink the water (thirtham) in which a Jangam&rsquo;s feet have been
washed; the lingam is tied on by the Jangam, and the convert eats with
other Ling&#257;yats. Women also undergo this ceremony, but in their
case shaving is omitted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>Disputes are settled by a panch&#257;yat (council) headed by one of
the community called Yejam&#257;n or Setti, assisted by the Reddi or
headman called Banakara. Where there is no Setti, the Reddi takes his
place. The Setti is appointed by the community, after the office itself
has been created by the Simhasanadhipati of the mutt. The other members
of the panch&#257;yat are not permanent, but are selected for the
occasion. The panch&#257;yat also tries offences against caste rules,
and imposes fine on the culprit. The money, when collected, is given to
some mutt or temple. Failure to pay is punished by excommunication. Any
one may be appointed Setti, but the post is hereditary. It is an
honorary post carrying no remuneration, and the enquiries of the
panch&#257;yat entail no expense, except in the cost of supplying
p&#257;nsup&#257;ri (betel leaves and areca nuts). The panch&#257;yat
is not limited in numbers, all the leading members of the community
being invited to attend. Appeals from the decisions of the
panch&#257;yat lie to the mutt to which the village is subordinate. In
Bellary appeals go to Ujjini. The orders of the mutt are final. The
Ujjini authorities say that the only punishment that can be inflicted
is to interdict the offender from all social intercourse. He is
practically &ldquo;put into Coventry&rdquo;; but is released on payment
of a fine to the guru, so the punishment is in fact a fine. The
appointment of a new Setti is a solemn function, resembling the
instalment of a church dignitary. The priests and Settis of
neighbouring villages assemble, and instal the new man. The following
is the order of precedence amongst them:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Matadaya.</li>
<li>(2) Matapati.</li>
<li>(3) Ganachari.</li>
<li>(4) Sthavaria or Gunari.</li>
<li>(5) Setti.</li>
<li>(6) Patna Setti.</li>
<li>(7) Kori Setti.</li>
<li>(8) Wali Setti.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>A ceremony called D&#299;ksha is said by some to be compulsory with
Jangams, male and female, in their eighth year, and the same is also
said to be required for lay Ling&#257;yats. The ceremony is performed
in order to impart to the recipient the sacred mantram called
Panchakshari. This is whispered in the ear by the guru. The rite is
evidently in imitation of the Br&#257;hman practice of imparting the
Gayatri mantram at the time of the Upanayanam or thread-tying ceremony.
The term D&#299;ksha is sometimes used to express the conversion
ceremony used in the case of a new-comer. It is an essential of the
faith that the sacred spell should be whispered in the ear by the guru,
and this explains the three word motto or &ldquo;guru, linga and
Jangam.&rdquo; But, in the case of lay Ling&#257;yats and of women, it
does not appear that D&#299;ksha is universal, and the sacred spell is
whispered in the ear when the lingam is tied.</p>
<p>Pollution periods are not observed. The indifference displayed by
Ling&#257;yats to the purification ceremonies prescribed by Hindu
custom is noticed by the Abb&eacute; Dubois, who quotes the Hindu
proverb which says &ldquo;There is no river for a
Ling&#257;yat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A simple ceremony is performed when a girl comes to maturity. This
lasts only one day. The girl takes an oil bath, and puts on clean
clothes and ornaments. Married women come and place in her lap two
cocoanuts, two dates, five limes, five areca nuts, five betel leaves,
and some rice. They sing some bright song, and then pass round her head
three times the wave offering (&#257;rati) of a light. They then
depart, after being presented with food and betel. This ceremony is
evidently copied from other castes, and with well-to-do Ling&#257;yats
is sometimes prolonged for several days. Holy water (thirtham) is
sprinkled over the head of the girl. No ceremonies are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>observed at subsequent menstrual periods, as no
pollution is attached to them.</p>
<p>No special diet or customs are observed during pregnancy by husband
or wife. The woman in her confinement is attended by her female
relatives and the village midwife. At the birth of a child, all the
female members of the family, and other women who attend the
confinement, bathe and give a bath to the mother and child. On the
second and third day, from five to ten women are invited. They bring
boiled water and turmeric paste to apply to the body of the mother. On
the third day a ceremony called V&#299;ralu is performed. V&#299;ralu
means the worship of the afterbirth. The midwife buries it at the outer
door, throws over the grave a piece of thread, dipped in turmeric
water, and some rice, turmeric powder, kunkuma (red powder) and
n&#299;m (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves. She offers to it kitchade,
a mess made of broken ch&#333;lam (millet: <i>Sorghum</i>) and a dish
of greens, and breaks a cocoanut. The mother, who wears on the right
wrist a piece of thread with a piece of sweet flag (<i>Acorus
Calamus</i>) tied to it, worships the grave with joined hands. The
women who have brought boiled water also wear similar threads on the
right wrists, and eat the ch&#333;lam and the greens. The midwife takes
away the offering made to the grave, and gets also her money
perquisites. The V&#299;ralu ceremony is observed in the belief that
the mother&rsquo;s breasts will thereby be fruitful of milk. The mother
for the first time, on the day after the ceremony is over, suckles the
child. Both of them receive dhulodaka (water from a Jangam&rsquo;s
feet). The child also receives from the Jangam the lingam, which is to
be his personal property for life and for eternity.</p>
<p>The name is given to a child on the sixteenth day after birth. Five
married women go to a well or river, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>where they worship
Gangamma, and return with a new pot filled with water. The mother
receives it at the entrance, and places it on some ch&#333;lam under
the cradle. After this, the child is put into the cradle, and is given
a name. The child&rsquo;s maternal uncle or aunt gives the name, and at
once all the women present assault the namer with their fists. After
this the Jangam and guests are fed, and guggeri (fried grain) is
distributed.</p>
<p>Marriage is both infant and adult. There is no difference in this
respect between Jangams and other Ling&#257;yats. Sexual license before
marriage is neither recognised nor tolerated. Open prostitution is not
permitted. On the other hand, it is condemned as a moral sin and a
social offence, and the party is punished by excommunication. There are
Basavis (dedicated prostitutes) amongst Ling&#257;yats. Polygamy is
permitted. Polyandry is strictly prohibited. Among the Ling&#257;yats,
marriage between brothers&rsquo; children is strictly prohibited.
Similarly, sisters&rsquo; children cannot marry. Marriage between some
classes of second cousins is also prohibited, <i>i.e.</i>, a
man&rsquo;s children may not marry the children of his paternal uncle
or of his maternal aunt. A man may marry his sister&rsquo;s daughter,
but, in the case of children of the younger sister, such marriages are
looked on with disfavour. The parties to a marriage have no freedom of
choice. It is arranged for them by their parents or by the elders of
their family, who come to an agreement as to the amount of teravu that
should be paid to the bride&rsquo;s family. This marriage price usually
amounts to 12 pagodas or 42 rupees, but is often more. In the case of a
second marriage, the amount is double. The presents to the bridegroom
generally consist of a pair of cloths, a turban, and a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>gold
ring. These gifts are not compulsory, and their amount and value depend
upon the circumstances of the bride&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>For a betrothal, the bridegroom&rsquo;s family come to the
bride&rsquo;s house on an auspicious day in company with a Jangam. They
bring a sir&#275; (woman&rsquo;s cloth), a kuppasa (jacket), two
cocoanuts, five pieces of turmeric, five limes, betel leaf and areca
nut. They also bring flowers for the susaka (a cap of flowers made for
the bride), gold and silver ornaments, and sugar and areca nut for
distribution to guests. The bride puts on the new cloths with the
ornaments and flowers, and sits on a folded kumbli (blanket), on which
fantastic devices have been made with rice. Some married women fill her
lap with cocoanuts and other things brought by the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party. Music is played, and the women sing. Five of them pick up the
rice on the kumbli, and gently drop it on to the bride&rsquo;s knees,
shoulders and head. They do this three times with both hands. Sugar and
betel are then distributed, and one of the bride&rsquo;s family
proclaims the fact that the bride has been given to the bridegroom. One
of the bridegroom&rsquo;s family then states that the bride is
accepted. That night the bride&rsquo;s family feed the visitors on
sweet things; dishes made of hot or pungent things are strictly
prohibited.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony, which often takes place some years later,
occupies from one to four days according to circumstances. In the case
of a four-day marriage, the first day is spent in worshipping
ancestors. On a second day, rice and oil are sent to the local mutt,
and oil alone to the relatives. New pots are brought with much
shouting, and deposited in the god&rsquo;s room. A pandal (booth) is
erected, and the bridegroom sits <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276"
href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>under it side by side with a
married female relative, and goes through a performance which is called
Surige. An enclosure is made round them with cotton thread passed ten
times round four earthen pitchers placed at the four corners. Five
married women come with boiled water, and wash off the oil and
turmeric, with which the bride and the bridegroom and his companion
have been anointed. The matrons then clothe them with the new cloths
offered to the ancestors on the first day. After some ceremonial, the
thread forming the enclosure is removed, and given to a Jangam. The
Surige being now over, the bridegroom and his relatives are taken back
to the god&rsquo;s room. The bride and her relatives are now taken to
the pandal, and another Surige is gone through. When this is over, the
bride is taken to her room, and is decorated with flowers. At the same
time, the bridegroom is decorated in the god&rsquo;s room, and,
mounting on a bullock, goes to the village temple, where he offers a
cocoanut. A chaplet of flowers called b&#257;shingam is tied to his
forehead, and he returns to the house. In the god&rsquo;s room a
panchakalasam, consisting of five metal vases with betel and
vibh&#363;ti (sacred ashes) has been arranged, one vase being placed at
each corner of a square, and one on the middle. By each kalasam is a
cocoanut, a date fruit, a betel leaf and areca nut, and one pice (a
copper coin) tied in a handkerchief. A cotton thread is passed round
the square, and round the centre kalasam another thread, one end of
which is held by the family guru, and the other by the bridegroom who
sits opposite to him. The guru wears a ring made of kusa grass on the
big toe of his right foot. The bride sits on the left hand side of the
bridegroom, and the guru ties their right and left hands respectively
with kusa grass. Hastap&#363;ja then <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>follows. The joined
hands of the bride and bridegroom are washed, and bilva (<i>&AElig;gle
Marmelos</i>) leaves and flowers are offered. The officiating priest
then consecrates the t&#257;li and the kankanam (wrist-thread), ties
the latter on the wrists of the joined hands, and gives the t&#257;li
to the bridegroom, who ties it round the bride&rsquo;s neck, repeating
some words after the priest. The tying of the t&#257;li is the binding
portion of the ceremony. Before the t&#257;li is given to the
bridegroom, it is passed round the assembly to be touched by all and
blessed. As soon as the bridegroom ties it on the bride, all those
present throw over the pair a shower of rice. The bridegroom places
some cummin seed and jaggery (crude sugar) on the bride&rsquo;s head,
and the bride does the same to the bridegroom. Small quantities of
these articles are tied in a corner of the cloth of each, and the
cloths are then knotted together. The bride worships the
bridegroom&rsquo;s feet, and he throws rice on her head. The newly
married couple offer fruits to five Jangams, and present them with five
pice. The relatives worship the bride and bridegroom, wash their feet
and offer presents, and the proceedings of the day terminate. On the
third day, friends and relatives are fed, and on the fourth day bride
and bridegroom ride in procession through the village, on the same
bullock, the bride in front. On return to the house they throw scented
powder (bukkittu) at each other, and the guests join in the fun. Then
follows the wedding breakfast, to which only the near relatives are
admitted. The married couple worship Jangams and the elders, and take
off the kankanam or consecration thread from their wrists, and tie it
at the doorway. The five matrons who have assisted are given presents
and dismissed, and the marriage is now complete. In a one-day marriage,
the above ceremonies are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href=
"#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>crowded into the short time
allotted. The remarriage of widows was one of the points on which
Basava insisted, and was probably one of the biggest bones of
contention with the Br&#257;hmans. Widow remarriage is allowed at the
present day, but the authorities at Ujjini see fit to disregard it.
They say that amongst Jangams it is prohibited, and that amongst the
other classes of Ling&#257;yats it is growth of custom.</p>
<p>The practice of widow remarriage is widely followed even among
Jangams, but amongst the stricter classes, who are probably under the
influence of their Br&#257;hman friends, it is discountenanced. The
parties to such a marriage are not allowed to take part in the marriage
ceremonies of others. A great deal can, however, be done when money is
forthcoming, and in one case a girl has recently been remarried
according to the form in use for original marriages. Every Jangam
probably has his price.</p>
<p>A widow cannot marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s brother or cousin.
The marriage goes by the name of Udiki, and corresponds to some extent
to the Gandarva form of the Hindus. The ceremony is a very simple one;
there is no music and no guests are invited. The parties go to the
temple in company with the Matapati or headman, and the bangle seller.
The latter puts glass bangles on the bride&rsquo;s wrists, and the
Matapati ties the t&#257;li. This last act ratifies the marriage
contract, and makes it indissoluble. In some cases the ceremony takes
place at night, as though the parties wished the darkness to cover
them, but this practice does not seem to be universal. A widower
generally takes a widow as his second bride; a bachelor will not as a
rule marry a widow. In connection with a case concerning the
Ling&#257;yat &lsquo;Goundans&rsquo; of the Wyn&#257;d, it is noted, in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>Indian Law Reports,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4130src" href="#xd21e4130" name="xd21e4130src">43</a> that
&ldquo;there is an immemorial custom by which Ling&#257;it widows are
remarried. Such marriage is styled, not kali&#257;nam, but odaveli or
kudaveli. It is not accompanied with the same ceremonies as a
kali&#257;nam marriage, but a feast is given, the bride and bridegroom
sit on a mat in the presence of the guests and chew betel, their cloths
are tied together, and the marriage is consummated the same night.
Widows married in this form are freely admitted into society. They
cease to belong to the family of their first husband, and the children
of the second family inherit the property of their own father.&rdquo;
Divorce is permitted on proof of misconduct. The husband can exercise
his right to divorce his wife by proving before a panchayet the alleged
misconduct. The wife can only claim to divorce her husband when he has
been outcasted. Wives who have been divorced cannot remarry. The above
answers are given on the authority of the Ujjini mutt. There appears to
be considerable divergence of opinion in other quarters. By some it is
positively asserted that divorce is not permitted under any
circumstances; that the husband and wife may separate on the ground of
incompatibility of temper or for misconduct; and that in these
circumstances the husband is at liberty to marry again, while the wife
is not. Others say that divorce is permitted, and that both parties are
at liberty to remarry. In connection with the Ling&#257;yats of South
Canara, it is recorded, in the Indian Law Reports,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4133src" href="#xd21e4133" name="xd21e4133src">44</a> that
&ldquo;second marriage of a wife forsaken by the first husband is
allowed. Such marriage is known as s&#275;rai &#363;diki (giving a
cloth); as distinguished from lagna or dhara, the first
marriage.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280"
name="pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>All castes included in Ling&#257;yat community follow the Hindu law
of inheritance, and succession is governed by the same.</p>
<p>As a rule Ling&#257;yats worship Basav&#275;swara and
V&#299;rabhadra, the former being the founder of their sect, and the
latter a son of Siva. They worship also the other sons of Siva,
Shanmukha and Vin&#257;yaka, and Parvati, wife of Siva. The other
deities of the Hindu pantheon are not reverenced. Some later saints are
sometimes regarded with reverence, but there does not appear to be any
great uniformity in this matter, and the Ujjini authorities declare
that no god except Siva is worshipped. This is clearly the correct view
of the religion, and it is evident that the worship of minor deities
was not countenanced by the founder.</p>
<p>It is a peculiarity amongst the Ling&#257;yats that they esteem the
Jangam or priest as superior even to the deity. They pay homage to the
Jangam first, and to Siva afterwards. The Jangam is regarded as an
incarnation of the deity. They allow him to bathe his lingam in water
with which his feet have been washed, and which for this reason is
regarded as holy water. With the same water they bathe their own
lingams, and drink the remainder. The motto of the creed quoted by Mr.
C. P. Brown is &ldquo;Guru, linga, Jangam.&rdquo; These three words
express the Ling&#257;yat faith, but in practice the Jangam is placed
first, and, as stated above, is worshipped as god upon earth. This
practice of bathing the lingams in holy water is universal, and
precedes each meal. The Jangam blesses the food in the name of Basava,
and eats before the others can begin.</p>
<p>Monday in every week is the Ling&#257;yat Sunday, and is sacred to
Siva. This day is observed everywhere, and no Ling&#257;yat will
cultivate his field, or otherwise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>work his cattle on a Monday.
This fact was noted by the Abb&eacute; Dubois. The following account of
the various festivals recognised by Ling&#257;yats was furnished by the
Dew&#257;n of the Sand&#363;r State, but, as he himself admits, very
few people really observe the rules:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>The month Chaitra.</i>&mdash;First day of the bright fortnight
being Ug&#257;di or new year&rsquo;s day, all take an oil bath and
feast, the first dish to be eaten being a porridge made of margosa
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) flowers, sugar candy or jaggery, dried
grapes, almonds, Bengal gram flour, poppy seeds, and cocoanut kernel.
Those who can afford it put on new clothing. The eating of margosa
flowers on Ug&#257;di is not, however, peculiar to the Ling&#257;yat.
On the full-moon day, called Davanadahunname (from davana, a scented
plant), they enjoy dainty dishes in honour of Hampe
Pompapathisw&#257;mi&rsquo;s car festival.</p>
<p><i>The month Vais&#257;kha.</i>&mdash;On the full-moon day called
Hagihunname (from hage, a young plant) cultivators make nursery beds,
and enjoy a good repast.</p>
<p><i>The month Jyesta.</i>&mdash;The full-moon day called Karuhunname
(from kare, a festoon). Bullocks are washed, painted, and taken out in
procession, when a festoon made of leaves, etc., and tied high across
the main street, is broken. On the new-moon day called
Mannueththina-amavasya, they make bulls with earth, worship them, and
eat a good meal.</p>
<p><i>The month Ash&#257;dha.</i>&mdash;On the full-moon day called
Kadlakadavena hunname, they make a mixture of ch&#333;lam or other
flour with a single grain of unbroken Bengal gram inside, boil it and
eat. Women strike one another with these cakes, which are either round
or oblong, and are tough. Before being eaten, they are cut into pieces
with a knife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>The month Sravana.</i>&mdash;The fifth day of the bright
fortnight, called N&#257;garapanchame. The image of a serpent, made of
mud taken from a snake&rsquo;s hole, is worshipped with offerings of
milk, soaked Bengal gram, rice, balls made of jaggery and fried
gingelly (<i>Sesamum</i>) called chigali, balls made of rice flour and
jaggery called tanittoo, cocoanuts, plantains and flowers. On each
Monday of this month, all the gods are worshipped with offerings of
dainty dishes, and Jangams are fed. This is the most important month in
the year. Those who can afford it have the Basava or other
Puran&#257;ms read and explained.</p>
<p><i>The month Bhadrapada.</i>&mdash;The fourth day of the bright
fortnight. The image of Gan&#275;sha, made of earth and painted, is
worshipped with an offering consisting of 21 harnakadubu, 21 chigali,
21 tanittoo, a cocoanut, flowers and incense. It is taken out in
procession on the 3rd, 5th or 9th day, and deposited in a well or
stream after the necessary worship. The new-moon day called
Malada-amavasya (from Mahalaya, a period comprising 15 days from full-
to new-moon), during which offerings are made to the manes of departed
ancestors.</p>
<p><i>The month Aswija.</i>&mdash;The first day of the bright
fortnight. Male children bathe, put on holiday clothes, and go to the
village school. They do so till the 10th or Dasami day. With them their
master makes house-to-house visits for annual presents. They sing and
play with the kolatam, a pair of painted round sticks about one foot in
length with a diameter of 1&frac14; inches. On the Dasami day, books,
accounts, scales and weights, measures and weapons are worshipped with
jambi (<i>Prosopis spicigera</i>), rich food, flowers and incense. All,
including Jangams, enjoy a good meal. In the evening they visit
temples, and offer cocoanuts to the idols. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>They
pay reverence to elders by giving them jambi, and falling at their
feet. On the same day, girls collect earth from ant-hills, and place it
in a heap in the village temple. Every evening they go to the said
temple with &#257;ratis (wave offerings), singing on the way, and
worship the heap. They continue this till the full-moon day called
Seegahunname. On the following day, <i>i.e.</i>, on the first day of
the dark fortnight, they worship in the same temple an image of Siva
and his consort Parvati seated on the sacred bull made of earth and
painted. They worship with offerings of cakes and other dainties, and
cocoanuts, flowers and incense, and give &#257;rati. The Matapati who
has installed the idol takes these offerings, and gives each girl two
idols of Kontamma, made out of the heaped earth previously worshipped
by them. They take them home in their &#257;rati platters. Within the
next three days, they go from house to house playing on kolu or kolatam
and singing, and receive money presents. These earnings they spend on
the worship of Kontamma by making sajja and gingelly cakes called konte
roti, and offering them. This worship is performed on the top of the
roof of a house. The girls eat up the cakes, and take Kontamma in
procession to a stream or well, and gently let her into the water,
singing songs all the while.</p>
<p>On the new-moon day, a religious observance called nope or nomulu in
honour of Gauri (another name of Parvati) is kept up. The observance
consists in offering to the goddess 21 karjikayi, 21 whole areca nuts,
21 betel nuts, 21 bits of turmeric, 21 chendu flowers, 21 tumbe huvvu,
a silk string with 21 threads and 21 knots, a cocoanut kernel, a date
fruit, kunkuma, a cocoanut, bukkittu and incense, in a winnowing fan
specially made with 21 fastenings. The fan is passed round the goddess
21 times. A face worked in silver, a new earthen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>pitcher or a metal pot with a twig of the banian
tree in it, well decorated, represents the goddess. The silk string is
allowed to remain before her that night. Next morning, offerings of
food, etc., are made to her, and the p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) ties a
silk string on the left arm if a female, or the right arm if a male.
That day being the Balipadyam day, men, women and children take an oil
bath very early in the morning, eat something, and put on new clothing.
Just before daybreak, women make two sets of cow-dung
Panchap&#257;ndavas, and keep one set on either side of the outer
threshold, and, sprinkling on them milk, butter and gh&#299;, worship
them. At the usual breakfast time, all the members of the family enjoy
a hearty meal with the newly married son-in-law, to whom they make
presents of cloths and gold according to circumstances. All that day
children let off crackers.</p>
<p><i>The month Kartika.</i>&mdash;On the fourteenth day of the bright
fortnight, girls bring ant-hill earth, and, depositing it in a temple,
follow the procedure observed from the tenth day of the bright
fortnight of Aswija up to the day on which the Kontamma was left in a
stream or well. They go through the various details in three days.</p>
<p><i>The month Pushya.</i>&mdash;The Sankranti (the day on which the
sun&rsquo;s progress to the north of the equator begins) festival is
observed. On the Bhogi day, <i>i.e.</i>, the day previous to Sankranti,
cakes made of sajja and gingelly, dishes made of pumpkin, brinjals,
sweet potatoes, red radish, raw chillies and chitr&#257;na (coloured
rice) are eaten. On the Sankranti day, more rich food, including
holigas (cakes made of jaggery, dh&#257;l and wheat), is eaten in
company with Jangams, who are dismissed with money presents and betel
and nut.</p>
<p><i>The month Magha.</i>&mdash;The full-moon day called
Baratahunname. This is a feasting day on which no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>ceremony is performed, but the people enjoy
themselves by eating good things. The fourteenth day of the dark
fortnight is the Sivarathri day, <i>i.e.</i>, the day sacred to Siva.
This should be a fasting and sleepless day, the fast being broken early
next morning, but very few observe these rules strictly.</p>
<p><i>The month Phalguna.</i>&mdash;The full-moon day is the day on
which the Holi festival takes place. It is not marked by any religious
observance beyond eating good things. The same is the case with the
new-moon day.</p>
<p>Br&#257;hmans are not employed as a general rule. The Jangam is the
priest of the Ling&#257;yat, and is called in for all ceremonies.
Br&#257;hmans are sometimes consulted in fixing auspicious days, and in
some cases are even allowed to officiate at marriages. This is the rule
in Sand&#363;r, and shows the tendency of modern times. The Ujjini mutt
is, however, still bigoted in its rejection of all Br&#257;hman
interference, though, with strange inconsistency, the elders of the
community themselves claim to be Br&#257;hmans. Jangams are now
studying V&#275;dic Sh&#257;stras, and may often be heard repeating
V&#275;dic hymns.</p>
<p>The dead are buried in a sitting posture facing towards the north,
but an exception is made in the case of unmarried people, who are
buried in a reclining position. Before the patient dies, the ceremony
called Vibh&#363;tidh&#257;rane or Vibh&#363;ti achch&#333;du is
performed. He is given a bath, and is made to drink holy water in which
the Jangam&rsquo;s feet have been washed. He is made to give the Jangam
a handkerchief with vibh&#363;ti (ashes), rudr&#257;ksha, dakshina
(coin) and t&#257;mb&#363;la (betel leaf). This is followed by a meal,
of which all the Jangams present, and the relatives and friends of the
patient partake. It appears to be immaterial whether the patient is
still alive or not. It is stated that, if the invalid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>survives this ceremony, he must take to the
jungles and disappear, but in practice this is not observed. The death
party resembles in some respects an Irish &lsquo;wake,&rsquo; though
the latter does not commence until the deceased is well on his way to
the next world. After death, the corpse is placed in a sitting posture,
and the Jangam, who has received the offering before death, places his
left foot on the right thigh of the body. The people present worship
the corpse, and the usual distribution of coins and betel to Jangams
follows. The body is then carried in a vim&#257;nam or bamboo chair to
the burial-ground. The grave should be a cube of nine feet dimensions,
with a niche on one side, in which the corpse is to sit. The lingam is
untied, and placed in the left hand; bilva leaves (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>) and vibh&#363;ti are placed at the
side; the body is wrapped in an orange coloured cloth; and the grave is
filled in. A Jangam stands on the grave, and, after receiving the usual
<i>douceur</i>, shouts out the name of the deceased and says that he
has gone to Kail&#257;sa or heaven.</p>
<p>Memorial ceremonies are contrary to Ling&#257;yat tenets, but in
this, as in other matters, the influence of the Br&#257;hmans appears,
and amongst some sections an annual ceremony is performed. The
performance of Sr&#257;dh, or the memorial ceremonial common to other
Hindus, is unknown. The Abb&eacute; Dubois tells us that a
Ling&#257;yat is no sooner buried than he is forgotten. He says,
&ldquo;The point in the creed of the Saivaites which appears to me to
be most remarkable is their entire rejection of that fundamental
principle of the Hindu religion &lsquo;marujanma&rsquo; or <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4234" title=
"Source: metempscychosis">metempsychosis</span>. From this it would
follow that they do not believe in ghosts. But there is a generally
accepted idea that evil spirits sometimes take possession of females.
This may be a rude way of expressing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>the fact that the
gentle sex is uncertain, coy and hard to please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Sr&#257;dh is unknown, once in a year on the new-moon day of
the month Bh&#257;drapada or in Aswija, they offer clothes and food to
ancestors in general, childless ancestors, and men who have died a
violent death.</p>
<p>The special object of worship is a bull, the animal sacred to Siva.
A bull is supposed to be used by Siva for riding. It is also painted on
Siva&rsquo;s flag.</p>
<p>Tattooing is confined to females. Children are tattooed in their
fifth year. A round mark, the size of a pea, is pricked between the
eyebrows, on the right cheek, and on the chin. Other marks are made on
the forehead. These marks are also made on the forearms and hands. The
pigment is of a green colour, but the recipe is not known. The skin is
pricked with b&#257;b&#363;l (<i>Acacia arabica</i>) thorns.</p>
<p>Females wear a s&#257;di about 8 yards long and 1&frac14; yards
broad. It is invariably a coloured one, with silk or cotton borders at
the edges and across at both the ends. One of the cross borders is much
broader than the other, and is showy. The s&#257;di is of different
patterns. It is tied below the waist with folds in front, the end with
the cross border passing round the trunk from left to right, and
covering the head. They wear also a kuppasa, which covers half the body
from the neck, and is fastened in the front by a knot.</p>
<p>In some families infants are branded with a hot needle on the
stomach, under the idea that disease is thereby warded off. Children
who suffer from fits are branded with a twig of margosa or with a glass
bangle.</p>
<p>As Ling&#257;yats were originally recruited from all castes, the
community must have included persons of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>nearly every trade.
At the present day the majority may be grouped under priests, traders
and agriculturists.</p>
<p>It is the idea of some Ling&#257;yats that Jangams are forbidden to
trade, and strictly speaking this objection is valid. But it is even
admitted at Ujjini that there is no such objection in practice. Many
wealthy traders may be found amongst the above class, and in the town
of Kampli there is a Ling&#257;yat guru who is held in great esteem,
and yet is the owner of two shops, the business of which he personally
conducts. It is even whispered that the head of the Ujjini Mutt is not
averse to increasing his income by a little discreet usury. The
majority of Ling&#257;yats in Bellary are tenant-farmers, or
self-cultivating pattad&#257;rs. It is said to be uncommon to find a
Ling&#257;yat daily labourer in the Bombay Presidency&mdash;they are
mostly landholders and cultivators or petty traders. They are
prohibited from doing such work as is required of a butcher, a toddy
drawer or seller, sweeper or scavenger. Anything connected with the use
of leather is an object of special abhorrence to a Ling&#257;yat. Even
the use of a leather bucket for irrigation purposes is by some of the
stricter members considered degrading. It is even supposed to be wrong
to touch one&rsquo;s shoe or sandals in the presence of others, and
beating with a shoe is a special insult. This last objection is
probably common to all castes.</p>
<p>There are few artisans, but a special sub-section called the
Hirekurnis are weavers. Oil-sellers are styled G&#257;nigas and
Sajjanag&#257;nigas. Flower-sellers are called J&#299;ru; those engaged
in making dairy produce, Gaulis ; those who do tailoring, Chippigas.
Members of the above trades under the above names are not exclusively
Ling&#257;yats. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289"
name="pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ploughing is never commenced in Pushya, as it is considered an
inauspicious month, but what was begun in the previous Margasira could
be continued through it. Those who did not begin in Margasira do so in
Magha, the month succeeding Pushya. Tuesdays and Fridays are auspicious
days for the commencement of this operation. They are also the
appropriate days for sowing. There is no restriction as to month, that
being entirely dependent on the season. Before ploughing commences, the
team of bullocks is worshipped. The horns of the animals are washed
with water, and covered with sacred ashes. A cocoanut is broken on the
yoke. Before sowing, p&#363;ja (worship) is offered to the
drill-plough. The hollow bamboos, through which the seed drops, is
daubed with chunam (lime), and the other parts with red earth. Bunches
of leaves of the sacred p&#299;pal, and bits of turmeric are stuck in
three or four places. To the drill, a string, containing marking-nut,
sweet flag, and pieces of palmyra leaf, is tied. Kunkuma is applied,
and to the whole apparatus food specially prepared is offered. This
takes place at home. The drill-plough is then carried to the field,
where, after the bullocks have been attached, a cocoanut is broken on
the cross beam. Reaping commences with the sprinkling of milk and
gh&#299; on the crop. At the threshing floor, a ceremony called Saraga
is gone through. A conical-shaped image made of cow-dung is set at the
foot of the grain heap. On its top are placed the tail hair of
bullocks, a single ch&#333;lam ear-head, a flower of the avari (bean)
creeper, and tummi flower (<i>Leucas aspera</i>). Before it are spread
the mess of ch&#333;lam and other food brought from home, and a
cocoanut is broken. Some of the mess is dissolved in buttermilk, and
thrown round the threshing floor. The man who throws it lays
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>the pot which contained it before the image, and
salutes the heap with joined hands. The residue of the ch&#333;lam mess
and other food is eaten by a Jangam, the cultivator, the guests,
servants and coolies. The grain in the heap is next winnowed and made
into a heap. It is measured just before sunset, neither sooner nor
later, after breaking the cocoanut which was secreted in the original
heap. The measurers sit with their faces towards the north. While the
measurement is proceeding, no one in the threshing floor may speak; nor
is any one allowed to enter it at the time. The belief is that, if
either of these happens, the grain in the heap will diminish. This
mysterious disappearance is called wulusu.</p>
<p>Rain in Rohini Karte (one of the twenty-seven asterisms in which
rain falls) is good for sowing, and that in Mrugasira and Ardra
appropriate. These three asterisms are suited for sowing ch&#333;lam.
Showers in Punarvasu, Pushya, and Aslesha are suitable for sowing
korra, saju and savi. Rain in Pubba and Wuttara is favourable to
cotton, korra and horse gram, and that in Hasta and Chitta to wheat,
ch&#333;lam, Bengal gram and kusumulu (oil-seed). Flashes of lightning
occurring at the exit of Ardra, augur good showers. The saying is that,
if it flashes in Ardra, six showers will fall. In Magha, weeding,
either by the hand or by bullocks, should not be done. Wind should not
blow in Wuttara. If it does, the grain in the ear-heads will be hollow.
There should be no lightning flashes in Swati. If there are, a pest
called benkihula will appear, and grain will not be formed in each
socket. Rain in Visakha destroys worms, and is good for pulses. Rain in
An&#363;r&#257;dha spoils them. A scare-crow in the shape of a human
being is set up in fields where there are crops, to scare birds and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>animals. It is made much in the same way as
elsewhere, with crossed sticks and a painted chatty (pot). The sticks
are covered with rags of cotton or a kambli (blanket). A cocoanut is
broken before digging for a well commences.</p>
<p>The Ling&#257;yats are strict vegetarians, and abstain from all
forms of liquor. The staple foods in Bellary are ch&#333;lam, cumbu,
r&#257;gi and korra. Ling&#257;yats will not eat, drink or smoke with
any one of another religion. This is the strict rule, but, as already
stated, K&#257;pu Ling&#257;yats will sometimes eat with a
non-Ling&#257;yat relative or friend. (<i>See</i> also Jangam.)</p>

<p><b>Madhya.</b>&mdash;Madhya or Madhaya is a sub-division of Bottada
and Sondi.</p>
<p><b>M&#257;diga.</b>&mdash;The M&#257;digas are the great
leather-working caste of the Telugu country, and correspond to the
Chakkiliyans of the Tamil area. They were first studied by me at Hospet
in the Bellary district, and at once formed a strong opposition party,
in the belief that I was going to select and carry off the strong men,
lest they should become kings, and upset the British R&#257;j. So
frightened were they, that they went in a body to live in the
Muhammadan quarter of the town.</p>
<p>At the Hospet weekly market I witnessed a mendicant youth lying
naked in a thorny bed of b&#257;b&#363;l (<i>Acacia arabica</i>) stems.
A loathsome spectacle was afforded by a shrivelled old woman with mouth
distended by a mass of mud the size of a cricket-ball, both eyes bunged
up with mud, and beating her bare breasts with her hands. The market
was infested by religious mendicants, some from Benares and
R&#257;m&#275;svaram, others from across the Hyderabad frontier, who
cadged persistently for tobacco <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>leaves, an onion or brinjal
(<i>Solanum Melongena</i>), a few chillies, a handful of grain, or a
pinch of salt, and helped to deplete the slender stock of the
market-sellers. One holy man from Sholap&#363;r was profusely decorated
with beads, ashes, brass snakes, and deities. Holding out for four pies
worth of betel leaves, while the stall-keeper only offered one pie
worth, he, after making a circle in the ground with his staff round his
sandals thickly studded with blunt nails, stood thereon, and abused the
vendor in language which was not nice. A Native Magistrate thereon
summoned a constable, who, hastily donning his official belt, took the
holy man in custody for an offence under the Act.</p>
<p>A conspicuous feature of Hospet are the block-wheel carts with
wooden wheels, solid or made of several pieces, with no spokes. Dragged
by sturdy buffaloes, they are excellent for carrying timber or other
loads on rough roads or hill-tracks, where ordinary carts cannot
travel. During the breezy and showery season of the south-west monsoon,
kite-flying is the joy of the Hospet youths, the kites being decorated
with devices of scorpions and Hindu gods, among which a representation
of Hanum&#257;n, one of the <i>genii loci</i>, soared highest every
evening.</p>
<p>It is fairly easy to distinguish a M&#257;diga from a B&#275;dar,
but difficult to put the distinction in words. The M&#257;digas have
more prominent cheek-bones, a more vinous eye, and are more unkempt.
The B&#275;dar, it is said, gets drunk on arrack (alcohol obtained by
distillation), whereas the M&#257;diga contents himself with the
cheaper toddy (fermented palm juice). The B&#275;dars resort freely to
the M&#257;diga quarters (M&#257;diga k&#275;ri), situated on the
outskirts of the town, and fenced in by milk-hedge (<i>Euphorbia
Tirucalli</i>) bushes. My Br&#257;hman assistant, hunting in the
M&#257;diga quarters for subjects for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>measurement,
unfortunately asked some B&#275;dars if they were M&#257;digas. To
which, resenting the mistake, one of them replied &ldquo;We call you
the M&#257;diga,&rdquo; and the Br&#257;hman stood crushed.</p>
<p>The Hospet M&#257;digas had their hair cropped short, moustache, and
trimmed beard. They wore the customary threads or charm cylinders to
ward off devils, and steel tweezers for removing the thorns of the
b&#257;b&#363;l, which is largely used as a fence for the fields of
ch&#333;lam and sugar. One man had suspended round his neck, as a
hereditary talisman, a big silver Venkatar&#257;mana bottu with the
n&#257;mam in the centre on an altar, and the chank and chakram stamped
on it.</p>
<p>As bearing on the social status of the M&#257;las and M&#257;digas,
which is a subject of dispute between the two classes, it may be noted
that all the billets in cotton factories which require any skill, such
as engine-drivers, valve-men, moulders, turners, etc., are held by
M&#257;las. The M&#257;digas are generally only three-anna wage men,
and do such work as turning a winch, moving bales, and other trivial
jobs. At a factory, whereat I stayed, at Ad&#333;ni, there were three
wells, viz.:&mdash;for M&#257;las, for M&#257;digas, and for the rest
of the workers, except Br&#257;hmans. And the well-water for the
M&#257;las was better than that for the M&#257;digas. A M&#257;diga
chindu, or sword-dance, was prohibited in 1859 and 1874. But a
petition, referring to its obscene nature, and its being the cause of
frequent collision between the M&#257;las and M&#257;digas, was
submitted to the Collector of Kurnool in 1887, by a missionary. The
dance was performed at festivals, held annually or triennially, in
honour of the village goddess, and during the time of threshing corn,
building a new house, or the opening of a newly-dug well. The dance,
accompanied by a song containing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295"
href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>grossly indecent reflections
against the M&#257;las, was also performed, under the excitement of
strong drinks, in the presence of the goddess, on the occasion of
marriages. One verse ran as follows: &ldquo;I shall cut with my saw the
M&#257;las of the four houses at Nandy&#257;l, and, having caused them
to be cut up, shall remove their skins, and fix them to
drums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right hand party,&rdquo; it is stated,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4383src" href="#xd21e4383" name="xd21e4383src">1</a>
&ldquo;resent the use by the left of palanquins at their marriages, and
so the M&#257;las are very jealous of the Chucklers (M&#257;digas)
carrying the bride and bridegroom through the streets, using tinkling
ornaments, etc. Riots sometimes occur when a strong feeling of
opposition is raised, to resent what they consider
innovations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rdquo; The M&#257;digas,&rdquo; Mr. N. G. Chetty writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4388src" href="#xd21e4388" name="xd21e4388src">2</a>
&ldquo;belong to the left-hand caste, and often quarrel with the
M&#257;las (right-hand). In 1871 a M&#257;diga, having contrived to
obtain a red cloth as a reward from the Police Superintendent, wore it
on his head, and went in procession on horseback by the main bazaar
street. This resulted in a disturbance, in which a European Inspector
was severely hurt by a M&#257;la, who had mistaken him for the
Superintendent. The two factions fixed, by mutual understanding, the
streets by which each was to proceed, and no quarrels have since
occurred.&rdquo; During the celebration of village festivals, an
unmarried M&#257;diga woman, called for the occasion M&#257;tangi (a
favourite deity), abuses and spits upon the people assembled, and they
do not take this as an insult, because they think that her spittle
removes the pollution. The woman is, indeed, regarded as the
incarnation of the goddess herself. Similarly, the M&#257;las use very
obscene language, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296"
name="pb296">296</a>]</span>when the god is taken in procession to the
streets of the caste people.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4393src" href=
"#xd21e4393" name="xd21e4393src">3</a> Concerning the M&#257;tangi I
gather<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4396src" href="#xd21e4396" name=
"xd21e4396src">4</a> that she is an &ldquo;unmarried woman of the
M&#257;diga class, chosen after a most trying ordeal, unless she
happens to be descended from a previous M&#257;tangi, to represent the
goddess. She must vindicate her fitness by suitable prophetic
utterances, and her nomination is not confirmed till she has obtained
divine approval at the temple of a certain village near Kumbam in
Kurnool. When she has been finally confirmed in her honours, she enjoys
the privilege of adorning her face with a profusion of turmeric and red
powder, and of carrying margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves about
her. She is unmarried, but without being bound by a vow of celibacy.
Her business is to preside at the purificatory ceremonies that precede
all festivities. When M&#257;lakshmi, or Poleramma, or Ankamma, or any
other of the village deities is to have her festival, the nearest
M&#257;tangi is applied to. Her necklace of cowry (<i>Cypr&aelig;a
moneta</i>) shells is deposited in a well for three days, before she is
allowed to put it on for the ceremony. She dons the necklace, and
marches behind the master of the ceremonies, who carries a knife,
wooden shoes and trident, which have been similarly placed for a time
at the bottom of a well. The master of the ceremonies, his male and
female relations, then stand in a line, and the M&#257;tangi runs round
and round them, uttering what appear to be meaningless exclamations,
spitting upon all of them, and touching them with her stick. Her touch
and saliva are believed to purge all uncleanliness of body and soul,
and are invited by men who would ordinarily scorn to approach her, and
it passes one&rsquo;s comprehension how <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>she should be
honoured with the task of purifying the soul and body of high class
Reddis and purse-proud K&#333;matis. It must be said that only very few
Br&#257;hman families keep up this mysterious ceremony of homage to the
M&#257;tangi. She is allowed to come into the house, that is to pass
the outer gate. There she besmears a certain spot with cowdung, and
places upon it a basket. It is at once filled with cooked food. A layer
of rice powder covers the surface of the food, and on it is placed a
small lamp, which is lighted. She then holds out a little earthenware
pot, and asks for toddy to fill it with. But the Br&#257;hman says that
she must be content with water. With the pot in her hand, and wild
exultant songs in her mouth, recounting her humiliation of Br&#257;hman
and Kshatriya, of saint and sovereign, she moves quickly round the
assembled men and women, scattering with a free hand upon them the
water from the pot. The women doff their petticoats, and make a present
of them to the M&#257;tangi, and the mistress of the house gives her
the cloth she is wearing. The men, however, with strange inconsistency,
doff their sacred threads, and replace them by new ones after a bath.
The origin of the supremacy of the M&#257;tangi is obscure, and
shrouded in legends. According to one of them, the head of Renuka, the
wife of the sage Bhrigu, who was beheaded by her lord&rsquo;s orders,
fell in a M&#257;diga house, and grew into a M&#257;diga woman.
According to another legend, a certain king prayed to be blessed with a
daughter, and in answer the gods sent him a golden parrot, which soon
after perched on an ant-hill, and disappeared into it. The disappointed
father got the ant-hill excavated, and was rewarded for his pains by
finding his daughter rise, a maid of divine beauty, and she came to be
worshipped as the M&#257;tangi. It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb298" href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>interesting to note
that M&#257;tangas were an ancient line of kings &lsquo;somewhere in
the south,&rsquo; and the M&#257;digas call themselves M&#257;tangi
Makkalu or children of M&#257;tangi or Durga, who is their
goddess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The system of making Basavis (<i>see</i> Deva-d&#257;si), which
prevails among the M&#257;digas of the Ceded districts, is apparently
not in vogue among those of the Telugu country, where, however, there
are, in some places, a class of prostitutes called M&#257;tangi,
M&#257;tamma, or M&#257;tha, who are held in much respect. In
connection with the Basavi system, it is recorded, in the Madras Law
Report, 1892, that &ldquo;upon the whole, the evidence seems to be to
establish that, among the M&#257;digas, there is a widespread custom of
performing in the temple at Uchangidurgam, a marriage ceremony, the
result of which is that the girl is married without possibility of
widowhood or divorce; that she is at liberty to have intercourse with
men at pleasure; that her children are heirs to her father, and keep up
his family; and that Basavis&rsquo; nieces, being made Basavis, become
their heirs. The Basavis seem in some cases to become prostitutes, but
the language used by the witnesses generally points only to free
intercourse with men, and not necessarily to receipt of payment for use
of their bodies. In fact, they acquire the right of intercourse with
men, without more discredit than accrues to the men of their caste for
intercourse with women who are not their wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ceremony of initiation into M&#257;tangihood is fully described
by Emma Rosenbusch (Mrs. Clough).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4417src"
href="#xd21e4417" name="xd21e4417src">5</a> In the Canarese country,
<i>e.g.</i>, at Tumk&#363;r in Mysore, the ceremony of initiation is
performed by a Vakkaliga <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href=
"#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>priest. A portion of the front
courtyard of the house is cleaned, and smeared with cow-dung. On the
space thus prepared, a pattern (muggu) of a lotus is drawn with red,
yellow, and white powders. The outline is first drawn with rice or ragi
(<i>Eleusine Coracana</i>) flour deftly dropped from between the thumb
and index finger. The interspaces are then filled in with turmeric and
kunkuma powder. Five small pots are arranged, one in the centre, and
one at each corner of the pattern. By the side of the pots are placed a
ball of sacred ashes, a new cloth, a piece of turmeric, camphor, and
plantain fruits. Plantain stems are set up at the corners of the
pattern. A string is passed seven times round the four corner pots, and
tied to the central pot. The woman who is about to become a
M&#257;tangi should live on fruits and milk for five days previous to
the ceremony. She is dressed in a white s&#257;ri, and seats herself on
the muggu close to the central pot. A bamboo basket, containing a pot
bearing the device of two foot-prints (of Ellamm&#257;), an earthen or
wooden receptacle, an iron lamp, and a cane, is placed on her head. The
&#256;s&#257;di sings songs about Ellamm&#257;, and the Vakkaliga
priest throws rice over the novice&rsquo;s head, feet, knees, and
shoulders, and ties two bottus (marriage badges), called respectively
Ellamm&#257;&rsquo;s and Parasur&#257;ma&rsquo;s bottu, on her neck.
The new and old M&#257;tangis bawl out Ekkalde J&#333;gavva. The
ceremony closes with the drinking of toddy by the M&#257;tangis and
&#256;s&#257;dis. The basket (adlige) containing the various articles
enumerated is the badge of a M&#257;tangi, who carries it with its
contents, and a few leafy twigs of the margosa tree (<i>Melia
Azadirachta</i>). The basket is wrapped up in a red or brown cloth, and
may not be placed on the ground. At the M&#257;tangi&rsquo;s house, it
is hung up by means of a rope, or placed in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>niche in the wall. It may be noted that the
M&#257;digas call the intoxicant toddy p&#257;lu (milk).</p>
<p>For the following interesting note on the M&#257;tangi institution,
I am indebted to an article by Mr. A. Madhaviah.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4436src" href="#xd21e4436" name="xd21e4436src">6</a> &ldquo;About
ten miles to the south-west of Cumbum, in the Kurnool district, and
within a mile of the village of Tudimilla, there is a narrow pass
between two hillocks known as Surabeswara Kona. Besides the more common
presences, we find here the following shrines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">(<i>a</i>) Saptham&#257;thas (seven mothers).</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) A curious temple, in which are found the idols of
Jamadhagni Bagaw&#257;n&mdash;the father of Parasur&#257;ma and the
local rishi&mdash;his wife Renuka D&#275;vi, and the Surabi.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Opposite to this temple is the curious shrine, not very
much bigger than a railway pointsman&rsquo;s box, dedicated to
M&#257;thangi. In this temple are found no less than five idols
arranged in the following order:&mdash;(1) a three-headed snake; (2)
another three-headed snake; (3) a female body, with the palms joined
reverentially in the worshipping posture in front, with the lower half
of the body snaky in form, and with a canopy of snaky hoods above; (4)
M&#257;thangi proper&mdash;a female figure of about 15 inches in
height, made of stone&mdash;with a short skirt, below which the feet
are visible, but no upper garment, and wearing a garland round the
neck. The right hand holds a snake-headed stick, while the left has an
adlika, a kind of sieve; (5) another similar figure, but without even
the skirt.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We shall now proceed to enquire who this M&#257;thangi was,
and how she came to be worshipped there. Jamadhagni Maharishi, known
also as Bagaw&#257;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301"
name="pb301">301</a>]</span>on account of his godly power and virtues,
married Renuka, the daughter of Renu, and had five sons by her, the
youngest of whom was the famous Parasur&#257;ma, an incarnation of
Vishnu. &lsquo;Once upon a time,&rsquo; says the Bhagavatapur&#257;na,
&lsquo;Renuka having gone to the Ganga, saw the king of the Ghandarvas
wearing garlands of lotus, to play with the Apsaras. Having gone to the
river to fetch water, she, whose heart was somewhat attracted by
Chitaratha (the king of the Gandharvas) who was playing, forgot the
time of Yajna (sacrifice). Coming to feel the delay, and afraid of the
curse of the Muni, she returned to the hermitage, and placed the
pitcher before the Muni, and remained standing with folded palms. The
Muni (Jamadhagni), coming to know of the unchasteness of his wife, got
enraged, and said &lsquo;O my sons! kill this sinner.&rsquo; Although
thus directed, they did not do so. The said (Parasu) R&#257;ma, who was
well aware of the power of the Muni in respect of meditations and
asceticism, killed, being directed by his father, his mother along with
his brothers. The son of Satyavati (Jamadhagni) was pleased, and
requested R&#257;ma to pray for any favour. R&#257;ma desired the
reanimation of those killed, and their forgetfulness of the fact of
their having been killed. Immediately did they get up, as though after
a deep sleep. R&#257;ma, who was conscious of the powers of his father
in regard to asceticism, took the life of his dear ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The version locally prevalent is somewhat different.
Jamadhagni Bagaw&#257;n&rsquo;s hermitage was near this Kona, and he
was worshipping the god Surabeswara, and doing tapas (penance) there.
One day, his wife Renuka D&#275;vi went, very early in the morning, to
the river Gundlacama to bathe, and fetch water for her husband&rsquo;s
sacrificial rites. She was accompanied, as was her wont <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>on
such occasions, by a female slave of the chuckler (leather-worker)
caste, as a sort of bodyguard and attendant. While she was bathing, the
great warrior Karthaviriyarjuna with a thousand arms happened to fly
across the sky on some business of his own, and Renuka saw his form
reflected in the water, and was pleased with it in her mind. It must be
mentioned that she never used to take any vessel with her to fetch
water, for her chastity was such that she had power to roll water into
a pot-like shape, as if it were wax, and thus bring it home. On this
day, however, she failed to effect this, try what she might, and she
was obliged to return home empty-handed. In the meanwhile, the sage,
her husband, finding that his wife did not return as usual, learnt
through his &lsquo;wisdom sight&rsquo; what had happened, and ordered
his son Parasur&#257;ma to slay his sinful mother. Parasur&#257;ma went
towards the river accordingly, and, seeing his mother returning, aimed
an arrow at her, which severed her head from her body, and also
similarly severed, with its unspent force, the head of the chuckler
woman who was coming immediately behind his mother. Parasur&#257;ma
returned to his father without even noticing this accident, and when
his father, pleased with his prompt obedience, offered him any boon, he
prayed for the re-animation of his mother. Jamadhagni then gave him
some holy water out of his vessel, and told him to put together the
dismembered parts, and sprinkle some water over them. Parasur&#257;ma
went off in great delight and haste, and, as it was still dark and
early in the morning, he wrongly put his mother&rsquo;s head on the
chuckler woman&rsquo;s trunk, and sprinkled water on them. Then, seeing
another head and another body lying close by, he thought that they
belonged to the female slave whom he had unwittingly killed, and he put
them also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>together, and re-animated them. He was extremely
vexed when he found out the mistakes he had committed, but, as there
was no rectifying them without another double murder, he produced the
two women before his father, and begged to be forgiven. The sage
finally accepted the person with his late consort&rsquo;s head as his
wife, and granted to the other woman the status of an inferior deity,
in response to her prayers, and owing to her having his wife&rsquo;s
body. This was the origin of M&#257;thangi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some permanent in&#257;m (rent-free) lands
belonging to this shrine, and there is always a M&#257;diga
&lsquo;vestal virgin&rsquo; known as M&#257;thangi, who is the high
priestess, or rather the embodied representative of the
Brahman-chuckler goddess, and who enjoys the fruits of the inams.
M&#257;thangi is prohibited from marrying, and, when a M&#257;thangi
dies, her successor is chosen in the following manner. All the chuckler
girls of the village, between the ages of eight and ten, who have not
attained puberty, are assembled before the shrine, and the invoking
hymns are chanted amid a flourish of trumpets, drums, and other
accessories. The girl who becomes possessed&mdash;on whom the goddess
descends&mdash;is the chosen vessel, and she is invested with the
insignia of her office, a round sieve, a bunch of margosa (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves, a snake-headed bamboo stick,
a piece of cotton thread rope with some cowries (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cypr&aelig;a moneta</i> shells) strung on it, and a small
vessel of kunkuma (coloured aniline powder). A vow of lifelong celibacy
is also administered to her. Curiously enough, this shrine is venerated
by all castes, from the Br&#257;hman downwards. We were informed that,
at the time of worship, the chuckler priestess dances about in wild
frenzy, and she is given toddy to drink, which she not infrequently
spits on her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>devotees, and even Br&#257;hmans regard this as
auspicious, and not in the least polluting. We had the pleasure of
witnessing a &lsquo;possessed dance&rsquo; by the reigning
M&#257;thangi, with her drummer in attendance. She is a chuckler woman,
about thirty years of age, and, but for the insignia of her office, not
in any way differing from the rest of her class. Though unmarried she
had several children, but this was apparently no disqualification. We
were standing before the shrine of the seven mothers when the drummer
invoked the goddess by chanting a Telugu hymn, keeping time on his
drum. The meaning of the hymn was to this effect, as far as we could
make out:&mdash;</p>
<p>Sathya Surabesa Kona! Gowthama&rsquo;s Kamadhenu! the headless trunk
in Sathya Surabesa Kona! your father Giri R&#257;zu Kamad&#275;va
Jamadhagni Mamuni beheaded the trunk; silently Jamadhagni cut off the
arms; did you, the headless trunk in Kamadhenuvanam, the headless trunk
of Jamadhagni, your father&rsquo;s golden sword, did you ask to be born
a virgin in the snake pit?</p>
<p>&ldquo;While chanting the above, the drummer was dancing round and
round the woman, and beating wildly on his drum. The woman began to
tremble all over, and soon it was visible that the goddess had
descended on her. Then the drummer, wilder and more frantic than ever,
began to praise the goddess in these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>Are you wearing bells to your ankles, O mother? Are you wearing
cowries, O mother? Dancing and singing, O mother! We pray to thee, O
mother! Possessed and falling on the ground, I implore thee, O mother!
O mother, who went to Delhi and Oruganti with a sieve in the
right-hand, with a wand in the left; with bells tinkling at her ankles,
the mother went to Oruganti town, the mother went away. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;During this chant, the woman vies with the drummer, and
dances fiercely round and round, always facing him. Then comes the
appeasing chant, which the drummer drawls out in a quivering and solemn
tone, and without dancing about:&mdash;</p>
<p>By the feet of the thirty-three crores, by the feet of the sixty
crores, by the feet of the D&#275;vas, peace !</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman then stands with closed eyes, panting for breath,
and quite exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On ordinary days, the M&#257;thangi goes about the villages,
collecting the offerings of her devotees, and, we take it, she is never
in much want. There are also local M&#257;thangis in other villages,
but they are all said to be subordinate to the Tudimilla woman, who is
the high Pontiff of the institution. We were informed that there was an
old palmyra-leaf manuscript in existence, describing the institution
and the ceremonies (mostly tantric and phallic) in detail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the M&#257;digas of Tumkur in Mysore, the M&#257;tangis must
apparently belong to one of two septs, Belliyoru or Malloru.</p>
<p>The M&#257;diga &#256;s&#257;dis, who are males, have to go through
an initiation ceremony very similar to that of the M&#257;tangi. But a
necklet of pebbles is substituted for the bottu, and the Vakkaliga
priest touches the novice&rsquo;s shoulders with flowers, turmeric
powder, and kunkumam. The &#256;s&#257;dis are musicians who sing songs
and recite stories about Ellamm&#257;. They play on a musical
instrument called chaudike, which is a combination of a drum and
stringed instrument. The M&#257;tangis and &#256;s&#257;dis, both being
dedicated to Ellamm&#257;, are eminently qualified to remove pollution
for many castes who are Ellamm&#257; Vokkalu or followers of
Ellamm&#257;. A lotus device, or figures of Pothu R&#257;ja and
M&#257;tangi, are drawn on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306"
href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>ground, after it has been
cleansed with cow-dung. The M&#257;tangi, with her insignia, sits in
the centre of the device, and the &#256;s&#257;dis, sitting close by,
sing the praises of Ellamm&#257; to the accompaniment of the chaudike.
The M&#257;tangis and &#256;s&#257;di then drink toddy, and go about
the house, wherein the former sprinkle toddy with the margosa twig.
Sometimes they pour some of the toddy into their mouths, and spit it
out all over the house. The pot, in which the toddy is placed, is, in
some places, called pallakki (palanquin).</p>
<p>The &#256;s&#257;dis&rsquo; version of the story of Ellamm&#257; is
as follows. She is the goddess for all, and is present in the tongues
of all except dumb people, because they have to pronounce the syllable
elli (where) whenever they ask a question containing the word where.
She is a mysterious being, who often exhibits herself in the form of
light or flames. She is the cause of universe, and the one Sakthi in
existence thereon. She is supposed to be the daughter of Girir&#257;ja
M&#363;ni and Javanikad&#275;vi, and the wife of Jamadhagni Rishi. Her
son is Parasur&#257;ma, carrying a plough. The town where she lives has
three names, Jambupuri, Isampuri, and Vijayanagara, has eighty-seven
gates, and is fortified by seven walls. She is believed to have for her
dress all kinds of snakes. Several groves of margosa trees are said to
flourish in her vicinity. She is worshipped under many names, and has
become Lakshmi, Gauramma, and Saraswati in Br&#257;hman houses, or
Akkumari in Vakkaliga houses. To the &#298;digas she is Gatabaghya
Lakshmi, to the Kurubas Ganga Mari, to the Oddes Peddamma and
Chinnamma, and so on. She is said to have proceeded on a certain day to
the town of Oragallu, accompanied by Jana M&#257;tangi. On the way
thither, the soles of M&#257;tangi&rsquo;s feet blistered, and she sat
down with Ellamm&#257; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>beneath a margosa tree. After
resting a short time M&#257;tangi asked Ellamm&#257;&rsquo;s permission
to go to a neighbouring &#298;diga (Telugu toddy-drawer), and get some
toddy to drink. Ellamm&#257; objected, as the &#298;diga Gauda was a
Ling&#257;yat, and M&#257;tangi would be compelled to wear the lingam.
When M&#257;tangi persisted, Ellamm&#257; transformed herself into an
ant-hill, and M&#257;tangi, in the guise of a young woman, went to the
&#298;diga Gauda with her cane (Jogi kolu) and basket, and asked for
toddy. The Gauda became angry, and, tying her to a date-palm
(<i>Ph&oelig;nix sylvestris</i>), beat her, and gave her cane and
basket to his groom. M&#257;tangi was further ill-treated by the Gauda
and his wives, but escaped, and went to the Gauda&rsquo;s brother, who
treated her kindly, and offered her toddy, of which he had sixty loads
on bullocks. All this he poured into the shell of a margosa fruit which
M&#257;tangi held in her hand, and yet it was not filled. Eventually
the toddy extracted from a few palms was brought, and the shell became
full. So pleased was M&#257;tangi with the &#298;diga&rsquo;s treatment
of her, that she blessed him, and instructed him to leave three
date-palms untapped as Basavi trees in every grove. She then returned
to Ellamm&#257;, and it was resolved to afflict the Gauda who had
treated her badly with all kinds of diseases. Still disguised as a
young woman, she went to him with sweet-smelling powders, which he
purchased for a large sum of money. But, when he used them, he became
afflicted with manifold diseases, including small-pox, measles, cancer,
asthma, gout, rheumatism, abscesses, and bed-sores. M&#257;tangi then
appeared before him as an old fortune-teller woman, whom the &#298;diga
consulted, and doing as he was told by her, was cured. Subsequently,
learning that all his misfortunes were due to his want of respect to
M&#257;tangi, he became one of Ellamm&#257;&rsquo;s Vokkalu.

Huizinga states that &ldquo;they live in hamlets at a respectable
distance from the villages of the caste people, by whom they are
greatly despised. Their habits are squalid in the extreme, and the
odour of a M&#257;diga hamlet is revolting. They perform all the lowest
kinds of service for the caste people, especially bearing burdens and
working in leather. They take charge of the ox or buffalo as soon as it
dies. They remove the skin and tan it, and eat the loathsome carcase,
which makes them specially despised, and renders their touch polluting.
Some of the skins are used for covering the rude drums that are so
largely used in Hindu festivals, and beaten in honour of the village
deities. The caste men impress the M&#257;digas into their service, not
only to make the drums, but also to beat them at their feasts. It may
be mentioned that nearly ten per cent. of the M&#257;digas are nominal
Christians, and, in some parts of the Nellore district, the Christians
form over half of the M&#257;diga population. This changes their habits
of life <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>and also their social position. Eating of
carrion is now forbidden, as well as beating of drums at Hindu
festivals, and their refusal in this particular often leads to bitter
persecution at the hands of the caste people. The main duty of the
M&#257;digas is the curing and tanning of hides, and the manufacture of
rude leather articles, especially sandals, trappings for bullocks, and
large well-buckets used for irrigation. The process of tanning with
lime and tang&#275;du (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>) bark is rough and
simple. [Tang&#275;du is said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4527src" href=
"#xd21e4527" name="xd21e4527src">9</a> to be cut only by the
M&#257;digas, as other classes think it beneath their dignity to do
it.] As did their forefathers, so the M&#257;digas do to-day. The
quality of the skins they turn out is fair, and the state of the
development of the native leather trade compares very favourably with
that of other trades such as blacksmithy and carpentry. The
M&#257;diga&rsquo;s sandals are strong, comfortable, and sometimes
highly ornamental. His manner of working, and his tools are as simple
as his life. He often gets paid in kind, a little fodder for his
buffalo, so many measures of some cheap grain, perhaps a few
vegetables, etc. In the northern districts, the M&#257;digas are
attached to one or more families of ryots, and are entitled to the dead
animals of their houses. Like the Vettiyan in the south, the
M&#257;diga is paid in kind, and he has to supply sandals for the
ryots, belts for the bulls, and all the necessaries of agriculture; and
for these he has to find the requisite leather himself; but for the
larger articles, such as water-buckets, the master must find the
leather. Of late years there is a tendency observable among
M&#257;digas to poach on each other&rsquo;s monopoly of certain houses,
and among the ryots themselves to dispense with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>the
services of family M&#257;digas, and resort to the open market for
their necessaries. In such cases, the ryots demand payment from the
M&#257;digas for the skins of their dead animals. The hides and skins,
which remain after local demands have been satisfied, are sold to
merchants from the Tamil districts, and there is generally a central
agent, to whom the various sub-agents send their collections, and by
him they are dried and salted and sent to Madras for tanning. In the
K&#299;stna district, children have little leather strings hanging from
the left shoulder, like the sacred cord of the Br&#257;hman, from which
is suspended a bag containing something put in it by a M&#257;diga, to
charm away all forms of disease from the infant wearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some places bones are collected by the M&#257;digas for the
Labbais (Muhammadans), by whom they are exported to Bombay.</p>
<p>The god of the temple at Tirupati appears annually to four persons
in different directions, east, west, north and south, and informs them
that he requires a shoe from each of them. They whitewash their houses,
worship the god, and spread rice-flour thickly on the floor of a room,
which is locked for the night. Next morning the mark of a huge foot is
found on the floor, and for this a shoe has to be made to fit. When
ready, it is taken in procession through the streets of the village,
and conveyed to Tirupati, where it is presented at the temple. Though
the makers of the shoes have worked in ignorance of each other&rsquo;s
work, the shoes brought from the north and south, and those from the
east and west, are believed to match, and make a pair. Though the
worship of these shoes is chiefly meant for the Pariahs, who are
prohibited from ascending the Tirupati hill, as a matter of fact all,
without distinction of caste, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311"
href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>worship them. The shoes are
placed in front of the image of the god near the foot of the hill, and
are said to gradually wear out by the end of the year.</p>
<p>At a pseudo-hook-swinging ceremony in the Bellary district, as
carried out at the present day, a B&#275;dar is suspended by a cloth
passed under his arms. The M&#257;digas always swing him, and have to
provide the hide ropes, which are used.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>In an exceedingly interesting account of the festival of the village
goddess &#362;ramma, at Kudligi in the Bellary district, Mr. F. Fawcett
writes as follows. &ldquo;The M&#257;diga Basivis (dedicated
prostitutes) are given alms, and join in the procession. A quantity of
rice and r&#257;gi flour is poured into a basket, over which one of the
village servants cuts the throat of a small black ram. The carcase is
laid on the bloody flour, and the whole covered with old cloths, and
placed on the head of a M&#257;diga, who stands for some time in front
of the goddess. The goddess is then carried a few yards, the
M&#257;diga walking in front, while a hole is dug close to her, and the
basket of bloody flour and the ram&rsquo;s carcase are buried. After
some dancing by the M&#257;diga Basivis to the music of the tom-tom,
the M&#257;digas bring five new pots, and worship them. A buffalo,
devoted to the goddess after the last festival, is then driven or
dragged through the village with shouting and tom-toming, walked round
the temple, and beheaded by the M&#257;diga in front of the goddess.
The head is placed in front of her with the right foreleg in the mouth,
and a lamp, lighted eight days previously, is placed on top. All then
start in procession round the village, a M&#257;diga, naked but for a
few margosa (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>and held by two others, leading the way. Behind
him are all the other M&#257;digas, carrying six hundred seers of
ch&#333;lum (<i>Sorghum:</i> millet), which they scatter; and,
following them, all the other villagers. It is daybreak, and the
M&#257;diga who led the way, the p&#363;jari (priest), and the women
who followed him, who have been fasting for more than twenty-four
hours, now eat. The M&#257;diga is fed. This M&#257;diga is said to be
in mortal terror while leading the procession, for the spirit or
influence of the goddess comes over him. He swoons before the
procession is completed. At noon the people collect again at
&#362;ramma&rsquo;s temple, where a purchased buffalo is sacrificed.
The head is placed in front of the goddess as before, and removed at
once for food. Then those of the lower S&#363;dra castes, and
M&#257;digas who are under vows, come dressed in margosa leaves, with
lamps on their heads, and sacrifice buffaloes, sheep and goats to the
goddess.&rdquo; A further account of the festival of the village
goddess Udisalamma, at Bandri in the Bellary district, is given by Mr.
Fawcett. &ldquo;A M&#257;diga,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;naked but for a
few leaves round his waist, leads the procession, and, following him,
are M&#257;digas with baskets. Fear of the goddess comes on the
M&#257;diga. He swoons, and is carried to the temple, and flung on the
ground in front of the goddess. After a while he is revived, bathed,
and given new clothing. This man is one of a family, in which this
curious office is hereditary. He must be the son of a married woman,
not of a Basivi, and he must not be married. He fasts from the
beginning of the festival till he has done what is required of him. A
young ram&mdash;the sacrifice sheep&mdash;is taken up by one of the
P&#333;tur&#257;zus, as if it were a child, its hind legs at either
side of his waist and its forelegs over his shoulders, and he bites its
throat open and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313"
name="pb313">313</a>]</span>shows his bloody mouth to the people. He
throws it down, and the M&#257;digas remove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an account of a festival, during times of epidemic, at
Masulipatam, Bishop Whitehead writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4563src" href="#xd21e4563" name="xd21e4563src">11</a> &ldquo;On
the last day, a male buffalo, called D&#275;vara potu (he who is
devoted to the goddess), is brought before the image, and its head cut
off by the head M&#257;diga of the town. The blood is caught in a
vessel, and sprinkled over some boiled rice, and then the head, with
the right foreleg in the mouth, is placed before the shrine on a flat
wicker basket, with the rice and blood on another basket just below it.
A lighted lamp is placed on the head, and then another M&#257;diga
carries it on his own head round the village, with a new cloth dipped
in the blood of the victim tied round its neck. This is regarded here
and elsewhere as a very inauspicious and dangerous office, and the
headman of the village has to offer considerable inducements to
persuade a M&#257;diga to undertake it. Ropes are tied round his body
and arms, and held fast by men walking behind him, to prevent his being
carried off by evil spirits, and limes are cut in half and thrown into
the air, so that the demons may catch at them instead of at the man. It
is believed that gigantic demons sit on the tops of tall trees ready to
swoop down and carry him away, in order to get the rice and the
buffalo&rsquo;s head. The idea of carrying the head and rice round a
village, so the people said, is to draw a kind of cordon on every side
of it, and prevent the entrance of the evil spirits. Should any one in
the town refuse to subscribe for the festival, his house is omitted
from the procession, and left to the tender mercies of the devils. This
procession is called Bali-haranam, and in this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>(Kistna) district inams (lands rent free) are
held from Government by certain families of M&#257;digas for performing
it. Besides the buffalo, large numbers of sheep and goats, and fowls
are sacrificed, each householder giving at least one animal. The head
M&#257;diga, who kills the animals, takes the carcase, and distributes
the flesh among the members of his family. Often cases come into the
Courts to decide who has the right to kill them. As the sacrifice
cannot wait for the tedious processes of the law, the elders of the
village settle the question at once, pending an appeal to the Court.
But, in the town of Masulipatam, a M&#257;diga is specially licensed by
the Municipality for the purpose, and all disputes are
avoided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In some localities, during epidemics of small-pox or cholera, the
M&#257;digas celebrate a festival in honour of M&#257;riamma, for the
expenses of which a general subscription is raised, to which all castes
contribute. A booth is erected in a grove, or beneath a margosa or
<i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i> tree, within which a decorated pot
(karagam) is placed on a platform. The pot is usually filled with
water, and its mouth closed by a cocoanut. In front of the pot a screen
is set up, and covered with a white cloth, on which rice, plantains,
and cakes are placed, with a mass of flour, in which a cavity is
scooped out to hold a lighted wick fed with gh&#299; (clarified
butter), or gingelly oil. A goat is sacrificed, and its head, with a
flour-light on it, placed close to the pot. The food, which has been
offered to the goddess, is distributed, On the last day of the
festival, the pot is carried in procession through the village, and
goats are sacrificed at the four cardinal points of the compass. The
pot is deposited at a spot where three roads meet, and a goat,
pumpkins, limes, flowers, etc., are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>offered to it.
Everything,except the pot, is left on the spot.</p>
<p>The M&#257;digas sometimes call themselves J&#257;mbavas, and claim
to be descended from J&#257;mbu or Adi J&#257;mbuvadu, who is perhaps
the J&#257;mbuvan of the R&#257;mayana. Some M&#257;digas, called
Sindhuvallu, go about acting scenes from the Mah&#257;baratha and
R&#257;mayana, or the story of Ankalamma. They also assert that they
fell to their present low position as the result of a curse, and tell
the following story. K&#257;madhenu, the sacred cow of the
Pur&#257;nas, was yielding plenty of milk, which the D&#275;vas alone
used. Vellam&#257;nu, a M&#257;diga boy, was anxious to taste the milk,
but was advised by Adi J&#257;mbuvadu to abstain from it. He, however,
secured some by stealth, and thought that the flesh would be sweeter
still. Learning this, K&#257;madhenu died. The D&#275;vas cut its
carcase into four parts, of which they gave one to Adi J&#257;mbuvadu.
But they wanted the cow brought back to life, and each brought his
share of it for the purpose of reconstruction. But Vellam&#257;nu had
cut a bit of the flesh, boiled it, and breathed on it, so that, when
the animal was recalled to life, its chin sank, as the flesh thereof
had been defiled. This led to the sinking of the M&#257;digas in the
social scale. The following variant of this legend is given in the
Mysore Census Report, 1891. &ldquo;At a remote period, J&#257;mbava
Rishi, a sage, was one day questioned by Isvara (Siva) why the former
was habitually late at the Divine Court. The rishi replied that he had
personally to attend to the wants of his children every day, which
consequently made his attendance late: whereupon Isvara, pitying the
children, gave the rishi a cow (K&#257;madhenu), which instantaneously
supplied their every want. Once upon a time, while J&#257;mbava was
absent at Isvara&rsquo;s Court, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316"
href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>another rishi, named
S&#257;nkya, visited J&#257;mbava&rsquo;s hermitage, where he was
hospitably entertained by his son Yugamuni. While taking his meals, the
cream that had been served was so savoury that the guest tried to
induce J&#257;mbava&rsquo;s son Yugamuni, to kill the cow and eat her
flesh; and, in spite of the latter&rsquo;s refusal, S&#257;nkya killed
the animal, and prevailed upon the others to partake of the meat. On
his return from Isvara&rsquo;s Court, J&#257;mbava found the inmates of
his hermitage eating the sacred cow&rsquo;s beef; and took both
S&#257;nkya and Yugamuni over to Isvara&rsquo;s Court for judgment.
Instead of entering, the two offenders remained outside, S&#257;nkya
rishi standing on the right side and Yugamuni on the left of the
doorway. Isvara seems to have cursed them to become Chandalas or
outcasts. Hence, S&#257;nkya&rsquo;s descendants are, from his having
stood on the right side, designated right-hand caste or Holayas; whilst
those who sprang from Yugamuni and his wife M&#257;tangi are called
left-hand caste or M&#257;digas.&rdquo; The occupation of the latter is
said also to be founded on the belief that, by making shoes for people,
the sin their ancestors had committed by cow-killing would be expiated.
This mode of vicariously atoning for deliberate sin has passed into a
facetious proverb, &lsquo;So and so has killed the cow in order to make
shoes from the skin,&rsquo; indicating the utter worthlessness and
insufficiency of the reparation.</p>
<p>The M&#257;digas claim to be the children of M&#257;tangi.
&ldquo;There was,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4582src" href="#xd21e4582" name="xd21e4582src">12</a>
&ldquo;formerly a M&#257;tanga dynasty in the Canarese country, and the
M&#257;digas are believed by some to be descendants of people who were
once a ruling race. M&#257;tangi is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>Sanskrit name for
K&#257;li, and it is possible that the M&#257;digas once played an
important part in the worship of the god. The employment of
Chakkiliyans and M&#257;diga women in Shakti worship gives some colour
to this supposition.&rdquo; According to Fleet<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4587src" href="#xd21e4587" name="xd21e4587src">13</a> &ldquo;the
M&#257;tangas and the Katachchuris are mentioned in connection with
Mangalisa, who was the younger brother and successor of Kirttivarma I,
and whose reign commenced in Saka 489 (A.D. 567&ndash;8), and
terminated in Saka 532 (A.D. 610&ndash;11). Of the M&#257;tangas
nothing is known, except the mention of them. But M&#257;tanga means
&lsquo;a Ch&#257;ndala, a man of the lowest caste, an outcast, a
kir&#257;ta mountaineer, a barbarian&rsquo;; and the M&#257;digas,
<i>i.e.</i>, the Mah&#257;ngs of this part of the country, usually call
themselves M&#257;tangimakkalu, <i>i.e.</i>, the children of
M&#257;tangi or Durg&#257;, who is their goddess. It is probable,
therefore, that the M&#257;tangas of this inscription were some
aboriginal family of but little power, and not of sufficient importance
to have left any record of themselves.&rdquo; There are allusions to
M&#257;tangas in the R&#257;mayana, and in Kadambari, a Sanskrit work,
the chieftain of the Cabaras is styled M&#257;tanga. The tutelary deity
of the M&#257;digas is Mathamma or M&#257;tangi, who is said to be
worshipped by the K&#333;matis under the name of
Kanyak&#257;param&#275;swari. The relations between the M&#257;digas
and K&#333;matis are dealt with in the note on the latter caste. There
is a legend to the effect that M&#257;tangi was defeated by Parasu
R&#257;ma, and concealed herself from him under the tanning-pot in a
M&#257;diga&rsquo;s house. At the feast of Pongal, the M&#257;digas
worship their tanning pots, as representing the goddess, with offerings
of fowls and liquor. In addition to M&#257;tangi, the M&#257;digas
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>worship Kattamma, Kattappa, Dandum&#257;ri,
Mun&#275;swara, and other deities. Some of their children are named
after these deities, while others receive Muhammadan names in
fulfilment of vows made to Masthan and other P&#299;rs.</p>
<p>When asked concerning their caste, the M&#257;digas always reply
&ldquo;Memu pedda inti vallamu,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, we are of the big
house. The following legend is current in the Cuddapah district
concerning a pool in the Rayachoti taluk called Akkad&#275;vatalakolam,
or the pool of the holy sisters. &ldquo;A thousand years ago, there
lived near the pool a king, who ruled over all this part of the
country. The king had as his commander-in-chief a M&#257;diga. This
M&#257;diga made himself powerful and independent, and built himself a
residence on a hill still called M&#257;diga Vanidoorgam. At last he
revolted, and defeated the king. On entering the king&rsquo;s palace,
he found seven beautiful virgins, the king&rsquo;s daughters, to all of
whom he at once made overtures of marriage. They declined the honour,
and, when the M&#257;diga wished to use force, they all jumped into
this pool, and delivered their lives to the universal
lord.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4604src" href="#xd21e4604"
name="xd21e4604src">14</a></p>
<p>The following are some of the more important endogamous
sub-divisions among the M&#257;digas:&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gampa dhompti, basket offering.</li>
<li>Ginna or th&#275;l dhompti, tray or cup offering.</li>
<li>Bh&#363;mi dhompti, earth offering.</li>
<li>Ch&#257;tla dhompti, winnowing basket offering.</li>
<li>Sibbi dhompti, brass vessel offering.</li>
<li>Chadarapa dhompti, square space on the ground offering.</li>
</ul>

<p>There seems to be some connection between the M&#257;digas, the
Mutr&#257;chas, and Gollas. For, at times of marriage, the M&#257;diga
sets aside one thamb&#363;lam (betel leaf and areca nut) for the
Mutr&#257;cha, and, in some places, extends the honour to the Golla
also. At the marriage ceremonies of the P&#363;ni Gollas, an elaborate
and costly form of Ganga worship is performed, in connection with which
it is the M&#257;diga musicians, called M&#257;diga Pambala vandlu, who
draw the designs in colour-powders on the floor.</p>
<p>The M&#257;digas observe the panch&#257;yat or tribal council system
for the adjustment of disputes, and settlement of various questions at
issue among members of the community. The headman is called Pedda (big)
M&#257;diga, whose office is hereditary; and he is assisted by two
elected officers called Dharmakartha and Kulambantrothu.</p>

<p>Widow remarriage (udike) is freely permitted, and the woman and her
children are received in M&#257;diga <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>society. But care is
taken that no one but the contracting parties and widows shall witness
the marriage ceremony, and no one but a widower is allowed to avail
himself of the form.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4710src" href=
"#xd21e4710" name="xd21e4710src">15</a> A man may get a divorce from
his wife by payment to her of a few rupees. But no money is given to
her, if she has been guilty of adultery. The bride&rsquo;s price varies
in amount, being higher if she has to cross a river. The elaborate
marriage ceremonial conforms to the Telugu type, but some of the
details may be recorded. On the muh&#363;rtham (wedding) day, a
ceremony called pradh&#257;nam (chief thing) is performed. A sheep is
sacrificed to the marriage (araveni) pots. The sacrificer dips his
hands in the blood of the animal, and impresses the blood on his palms
on the wall near the door leading to the room in which the pots are
kept. The bridegroom&rsquo;s party bring betel nuts, limes, a golden
bead, a bonthu (unbleached cotton thread), rice, and turmeric paste.
The maternal uncle of the bride gives five betel leaves and areca nuts
to the Pedda M&#257;diga, and, putting the bonthu round the
bride&rsquo;s neck, ties the golden bead thereon. The ceremony
concludes with the distribution of p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri in the
following order: ancestors, Mutr&#257;chas, Gollas, M&#257;digas, the
Pedda M&#257;diga, and the assembled guests. The Pedda M&#257;diga has
to lift, at one try, a tray containing cocoanuts and betel with his
right hand. In his hand he holds a knife, of which the blade is passed
over the forefinger, beneath the middle and fourth fingers, and over
the little finger. This ceremony is called thonuku thamb&#363;lam, or
betel and nuts likely to be spilt on the floor. The bridegroom, after a
bath, proceeds to the temple, where cloths, the b&#257;shingam, bottu
(marriage badge), etc., are placed in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>front of the god, and
then taken to a jammi tree (<i>Prosopis spicigera</i>), which is
worshipped. The bottu is usually a disc of gold, but, if the family is
hard-up, or in cases of widow remarriage, a bit of turmeric or folded
mango leaf serves as a substitute for it. On the third day, the wrist
threads (kankanam) are removed, and dhomptis, or offerings of food to
the gods, are made, with variations according to the dhompti to which
the celebrants belong. An illustration may be taken from the Gampa
dhompti. The contracting parties procure a quantity of rice, jaggery
(crude sugar), and gh&#299; (clarified butter), which are cooked, and
moulded into an elongated mass, and placed in a new bamboo basket
(gampa). In the middle of the mass, which is determined with a string,
a twig, with a wick at one end, is set up, and two similar twigs are
stuck into the ends of the mass. P&#363;ja (worship) is performed, and
the mass is distributed among the daughters of the house and other near
relations, but not among members of other dhomptis. The bride and
bridegroom take a small portion from the mass, which is called dhonga
muddha, or the mass that is stolen. The bottu is said<a class="noteref"

or drummer. This office is hereditary, but each successor to it has to
be regularly ordained by a Kuruba guru at the local M&#257;diga shrine,
the chief item in the ceremony being tying round the neck of the
candidate a thread bearing a representation of the goddess, and on
either side of this five white beads. Henceforth the Thavatiga is on no
account to engage in the caste profession of leather-work, but lives on
fees collected at weddings, and by begging. He goes round <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>to
the houses of the caste with a little drum slung over his shoulder, and
collects contributions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The M&#257;diga marriages are said to be conducted with much
brawling and noise, owing to the quantity of liquor consumed on such
occasions. Among the M&#257;digas, as among the Kammas, Gangimakkulu,
and M&#257;las, marriage is said not to be consummated until three
months after its celebration. This is apparently because it is
considered unlucky to have three heads of a household within a year of
marriage. By the delay, the birth of the child should take place only
in the second year, so that, during the first year, there will be only
two heads, husband and wife.</p>
<p>At the first menstrual period a girl is under pollution for ten
days, when she bathes. Betel leaves and nuts, and a rupee are placed in
front of the Pedda M&#257;diga, who takes a portion thereof for
himself, and distributes what remains among those who have assembled.
Sometimes, just before the return of the girl to the house, a sheep is
killed in front of the door, and a mark made on her face with the
blood.</p>
<p>The M&#257;digas dispose of their dead both by burial and cremation.
The body is said to be &ldquo;buried naked, except for a few leaves.
Children are interred face downwards. Pregnant women are burnt. The
bier is usually made of the milk-hedge (<i>Euphorbia Tirucalli</i>)
plant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4734src" href="#xd21e4734"
name="xd21e4734src">17</a> The grave is dug by a M&#257;la
Vettiv&#257;du. The chinnadhinam ceremony is performed on the third
day. On the grave a mass of mud is shaped into the form of an idol, to
which are offered rice, cocoanuts, and jaggery (crude sugar) placed on
leaves, one of which is set apart for the crows. Three stones are
arranged in the form <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323"
name="pb323">323</a>]</span>of a triangle, and on them is set a pot
filled with water, which trickles out of holes made in the bottom of
the pot. The peddadhinam is performed, from preference on a Wednesday
or Sunday, towards the close of the third week after death. The son, or
other celebrant of the rites, sets three stones on the grave, and
offers food thereto. Food is also offered to the crows by the relations
of the deceased, and thrown into a river or tank (pond), if the crows
do not eat it. They all go to a tank, and make on the bank thereof an
effigy, if the dead person was a female. To married women, winnows and
glass bangles are offered. The bangles of a widow, and waist-thread of
a widower, are removed within an enclosure on the bank. At night
stories of Ankamma and M&#257;tangi are recited by Bain&#275;dus or
Pambalas, and if a M&#257;tangi is available, homage is done to
her.</p>
<p>In some places, M&#257;digas have their own washermen and barbers.
But, in the northern districts, the caste washerman does their washing,
the cloths being steeped in water, and left for the washerman to take.
&ldquo;The M&#257;digas,&rdquo; Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4741src" href="#xd21e4741" name="xd21e4741src">18</a>
&ldquo;may not use the wells of the better classes, though, when water
is scarce, they get over this last prohibition by employing some one in
the higher ranks to draw water for them from such wells, and pour it
into their chatties. In other districts they have to act as their own
barbers and washermen, but in Anantap&#363;r this disability is
somewhat relaxed, as the barbers make no objection to let them (and
other low castes such as the M&#257;las) use their razors for a
consideration, and the dh&#333;bis will wash their clothes, as long as
they themselves first unroll them, and dip them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>into
the water. This act is held to remove the pollution, which would
otherwise attach to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like many castes, the M&#257;digas have beggar classes attached to
their community, who are called Dakkali and M&#257;stiga. The Dakkalis
may not enter the M&#257;diga settlement. They sing songs in praise of
the M&#257;digas, who willingly remunerate them, as their curses are
believed to be very effective. The M&#257;stigas may enter the
settlement, but not the huts. It is said to be a good omen to a
Ling&#257;yat, if he sees a M&#257;diga coming in front.</p>
<p>G&#333;sangi is often used as a synonym for M&#257;diga. Another
synonym is Purav&#257;batta, which is said to mean people older than
the world by six months. At the Madras census, 1901, Chakara, Chundi,
and Pavini or Vayani were returned as sub-castes, and M&#257;yikkan was
taken as the Malabar equivalent for M&#257;diga.</p>
<p>Concerning the M&#257;digas of Mysore, Mr. T. Ananda Row writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4752src" href="#xd21e4752" name=
"xd21e4752src">19</a> &ldquo;The M&#257;digas are by religion
Vaishnavites, Saivites, and Sakteyas, and have five different gurus
belonging to mutts at Kadave, Kodihalli, Kongarli, Nelamangala, and
Konkallu. The tribe is sometimes called Jambava or M&#257;tanga. It is
divided into two independent sub-divisions, the Desabhaga and the
others, between whom there is no intermarriage. The former, though
under the above named mutts, acknowledge Srivaishnava Br&#257;hmins as
their gurus, to whom they pay homage on all ceremonial occasions. The
Desabhaga division has six sub-classes, viz.: Billoru (bowmen); Malloru
(mallu = fight?); Amar&#257;vatiyavaru (after a town); M&#363;nigalu
(M&#363;ni or rishi); Y&#275;namaloru (buffalo); Morabuvvadavaru (those
who place food in a winnow). The M&#257;digas are mostly field
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>labourers, but some of them till land, either
leased or their own. In urban localities, on account of the value in
the rise of skins, they have attained to considerable affluence, both
on account of the hides supplied by them, and their work as tanners,
shoe-makers, etc. Only 355 persons returned g&#333;tras, such as
M&#257;tangi, Mareecha, and Jambava-rishi.&rdquo; At the Mysore census,
1891, some M&#257;digas actually returned themselves as M&#257;tanga
Br&#257;hmans, producing for the occasion a certain so-called
Pur&#257;na as their charter.</p>

not be touched. The Panta Reddi women of this g&#333;tra will not, like
those of other castes, use the flower-bracts for the purpose of
adorning themselves. There is a belief, in Southern India, that the
fragrant male inflorescence harbours a tiny snake, which is more deadly
than the cobra, and that incautious smelling thereof may lead to
death.</p>
<p><b>M&#257;gura.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report,
1901, as a small caste of Oriya leaf-plate makers and <span class=

tracks.</p>

<p><b>Mahant.</b>&mdash;The Mahant is the secular head and trustee of
the temple at Tirumala (Upper Tirupati) in the North Arcot district,
and looks after the worldly affairs of the sw&#257;mi (god).
&ldquo;Tirupati,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4813src" href="#xd21e4813" name="xd21e4813src">20</a>
&ldquo;unlike most other temples, has no dancing-girls attached to it,
and not to be strictly continent upon the sacred hill is a deadly sin.
Of late years, however, even celibate Bair&#257;gis and priests take
their paramours up with them, and the pilgrims follow suit. Everything
is held to betoken the approaching downfall of the temple&rsquo;s
greatness. The irregular life of the Mahant Balar&#257;m D&#257;s sixty
years ago caused a great ferment, though similar conduct now would
probably hardly attract notice. He was ejected from his office by the
unanimous voice of his disciples, and one G&#333;vardhan D&#257;s,
whose life was consistent with the holy office, was elected, and
installed in the math (monastery) near the temple. Balar&#257;m
D&#257;s, however, collected a body of disbanded peons from the
p&#257;laiyams, and, arming them, made an attack upon the building. The
walls were scaled, and the new Mahant with his disciples shut
themselves up in an inner apartment. In an attempt at rescue, one man
was killed, and three were seriously wounded. A police force was sent
to co-operate with the Tirupati poligars (feudal chiefs), but could
effect nothing till the insurgent peons were threatened with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>loss of all their lands. This broke up the band,
and Balar&#257;m D&#257;s&rsquo; followers deserted him. When the gates
were broken open, it was found that he and a few staunch followers had
committed suicide. But perhaps the greatest scandal which has occurred
in the history of the math was that which ended in the conviction of
the present Mahant&rsquo;s predecessor, Bhagav&#257;n D&#257;s. He was
charged with having misappropriated a number of gold coins of
considerable value, which were supposed to have been buried beneath the
great flagstaff. A search warrant was granted, and it was discovered
that the buried vessels only contained copper coins. The Mahant was
convicted of the misappropriation of the gold, and was sentenced to two
years&rsquo; rigorous imprisonment, but this was reduced to one year by
the High Court. On being released from jail, he made an effort to oust
his successor, and acquire possession of the math by force. For this he
was again sent to jail, for six months, and required to furnish
security to be of good behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded by Sir M. E. Grant Duff,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4820src" href="#xd21e4820" name="xd21e4820src">21</a> formerly
Governor of Madras, that &ldquo;while the municipal address was being
read to me, a huge elephant, belonging to the Zemindar of Kalahastri, a
great temporal chief, charged a smaller elephant belonging to the
Mahant or High Priest of Tripaty, thus disestablishing the church much
more rapidly, alas! than we did in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Mahanti.</b>&mdash;Mahanti is, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
defined as &ldquo;a caste akin to the Koronos or Karnams (writers and
accountants). The name is sometimes taken by persons excommunicated
from other castes.&rdquo; The word means great, or prestige. According
to a note submitted to me, the Mahantis gradually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>became Karnams, with the title of Patnaik, but
there is no intermarriage between them and the higher classes of
Karnams. The Mahantis of Orissa are said to still maintain their
respectability, whereas in Ganjam they have as a class degenerated, so
much so that the term Mahanti is now held up to ridicule.</p>
<p><b>Mah&#257;p&#257;tro.</b>&mdash;Said to be a title sold by the
caste council to Kh&#333;duras. Also a title of Badh&#333;yis, and
other Oriya castes.</p>
<p><b>Mahar&#257;na.</b>&mdash;A title of Badh&#333;yi.</p>
<p><b>Mah&#275;swara</b> (Siva).&mdash;A synonym of Jangams (priests of
the Ling&#257;yats). The Jangams of the S&#299;lavants, for example,
are known by this name.</p>
<p><b>Mail&#257;ri.</b>&mdash;The Mail&#257;ris are a class of beggars,
who are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4845src" href="#xd21e4845"
name="xd21e4845src">22</a> to &ldquo;call themselves a sub-division of
the Balijas, and beg from K&#333;matis only. Their ancestors were
servants of Kannyakammav&#257;ru (or Kannik&#257; Amma, the virgin
goddess of the K&#333;matis), who burnt herself to avoid falling into
the hands of R&#257;ja Vishnu Vardhana. On this account, they have the
privilege of collecting certain fees from all the K&#333;matis. The
fee, in the Kurnool district, is eight annas per house. When he demands
the fee, a Mail&#257;ri appears in full dress (k&#257;si), which
consists of brass human heads tied to his loins, and brass cups to his
head; a looking-glass on the abdomen; a bell ringing from his girdle; a
bangle on his forearm ; and wooden shoes on his feet. In this dress he
walks, holding an umbrella, through the streets, and demands his fee.
If the fee is not paid, he again appears, in a more frightful form
called Bh&#363;thak&#257;si. He shaves his whiskers, and, almost naked,
proceeds to the burning-ground, where he makes rati, or different
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>kinds of coloured rice, and, going to the
K&#333;matis, extorts his fee.&rdquo; I am informed that the
Mail&#257;ris travel about with an image of Kannyakamma, which they
exhibit, while they sing in Telugu the story of her life.</p>
<p>The Mail&#257;ris are stated, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, to
be also called B&#257;la Jangam. Mail&#257;ri (washerman) is also an
exogamous sept of the M&#257;las.</p>
<p><b>Majji.</b>&mdash;Recorded as a title of Bagatas, Doluvas, and
Kurumos, and as a sept of Nagar&#257;lus. In the Madras Census Report,
1901, it is described as a title given to the head peons of
Biss&#333;yis in the M&#257;liahs.</p>
<p><b>Majjiga</b> (butter-milk).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
B&#333;ya.</p>
<p><b>Majjula.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of Korono.</p>
<p><b>Majjulu.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
as &ldquo;cultivators in Vizagapatam, and shik&#257;ris (hunters) and
fishermen in Ganjam. They have two endogamous divisions, the Majjulus
and the R&#257;cha Majjulus, the members of the latter of which wear
the sacred thread, and will not eat with the former. In their customs
they closely resemble the K&#257;pus, of which caste they are perhaps a
sub-division. For their ceremonies they employ Oriya Br&#257;hmans, and
Telugu Nambis. Widow marriage is allowed. They burn their dead, and are
said to perform sr&#257;ddhas (memorial services). They worship all the
village gods and goddesses, and eat meat. They have no
titles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>M&#257;kado</b> (monkey).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Bottada.</p>
<p><b>Makkath&#257;yam.</b>&mdash;The name, in the Malay&#257;lam
country, for the law of inheritance from father to son. The Canarese
equivalent thereof is makkalsanth&#257;nam.</p>
<p><b>M&#257;la.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;The M&#257;las,&rdquo; Mr. H. A.
Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4881src" href="#xd21e4881"
name="xd21e4881src">23</a> &ldquo;are the Pariahs of the Telugu
country. Dr. Oppert <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330"
name="pb330">330</a>]</span>derives the word from a Dravidian root
meaning a mountain, which is represented by the Tamil malai, Telugu
m&#257;la, etc., so that M&#257;la is the equivalent of Paraiyan, and
also of Mar or Mhar and the M&#257;l of Western and Central Bengal. I
cannot say whether there is sufficient ground for the assumption that
the vowel of a Dravidian root can be lengthened in this way. I know of
no other derivation of M&#257;la. [In C. P. Brown&rsquo;s Telugu
Dictionary it is derived from maila, dirty.] The M&#257;las are almost
equally inferior in position to the M&#257;digas. They eat beef and
drink heavily, and are debarred entrance to the temples and the use of
the ordinary village wells, and have to serve as their own barbers and
washermen. They are the musicians of the community, and many of them
(for example in the villages near Jammalamadugu in the Cuddapah
district) weave the coarse white cotton fabrics usually worn by
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The M&#257;las will not take water from the same well as the
M&#257;digas, whom they despise for eating carrion, though they eat
beef themselves.</p>
<p>Both M&#257;las and Tamil Paraiyans belong to the right-hand
section. In the Bellary district the M&#257;las are considered to be
the servants of the Banajigas (traders), for whom they do certain
services, and act as caste messengers (chalav&#257;thi) on the occasion
of marriages and funerals. At marriages, six M&#257;las selected from
certain families, lead the procession, carrying flags, etc., and sit in
the pial (verandah) of the marriage house. At funerals, a M&#257;la
carries the brass ladle bearing the insignia of the right-hand section,
which is the emblem of the authority of the D&#275;sai or headman of
the section.</p>
<p>The M&#257;las have their own dancing girls (Basavis), barbers, and
musicians (Bain&#275;dus), D&#257;saris or priests, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>and
beggars and bards called M&#257;stigas and Pambalas (drum people), who
earn their living by reciting stories of Ankamma, etc., during the
funeral ceremonies of some Telugu castes, acting as musicians at
marriages and festivals to the deities, begging, and telling fortunes.
Other beggars are called Nityula (Nitiyad&#257;su, immortal). In some
places, Ts&#257;kalas (washerman caste) will wash for the M&#257;las,
but the clothes must be steeped in water, and left till the
Ts&#257;kala comes for them. The M&#257;las will not eat food prepared
or touched by Kamsalas, M&#275;daras, M&#257;digas, B&#275;ri Chettis,
B&#333;yas, or Bhatr&#257;zus. The condition of the M&#257;las has, in
recent times, been ameliorated by their reception into mission
schools.</p>
<p>In a case, which came before the High Court of Madras on appeal a
few years ago, a M&#257;la, who was a convert to Christianity, was
sentenced to confinement in the stocks for using abusive language. The
Judge, in summing up, stated that &ldquo;the test seems to be not what
is the offender&rsquo;s creed, whether Muhammadan, Christian, or Hindu,
but what is his caste. If he belongs to one of the lower castes, a
change of creed would not of itself, in my judgment, make any
difference, provided he continues to belong to the caste. If he
continues to accept the rules of the caste in social and moral matters,
acknowledges the authority of the headmen, takes part in caste meetings
and ceremonies, and, in fact, generally continues to belong to the
castes, then, in my judgment, he would be within the purview of the
regulation. If, on the other hand, he adopts the moral standards of
Christianity instead of those in his caste, if he accepts the authority
of his pastors and teachers in place of that of the headman of the
caste, if he no longer takes part in the distinctive meetings and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span>ceremonies of the caste ... then he can no
longer be said to belong to one of the lower castes of the people, and
his punishment by confinement in the stocks is no longer
legal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between the M&#257;las and M&#257;digas there is no love lost, and
the latter never allow the former, on the occasion of a festival, to go
in palanquins or ride on horseback. Quite recently, in the Nellore
district, a horse was being led at the head of a M&#257;diga marriage
procession, and the M&#257;las followed, to see whether the bridegroom
would mount it. To the disgust of the M&#257;digas, the young man
refused to get on it, from fear lest he should fall off.</p>
<p>The M&#257;las will not touch leather shoes, and, if they are
slippered with them, a fine is inflicted, and the money spent on
drink.</p>
<p>Of the share which the M&#257;las take in a village festival in the
Cuddapah district, an excellent account is given by Bishop
Whitehead.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4905src" href="#xd21e4905" name=
"xd21e4905src">24</a> &ldquo;The village officials and leading
ryots,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;collect money for the festival, and
buy, among other things, a barren sheep and two lambs. Peddamma and
Chinnamma are represented by clay images of female form made for the
occasion, and placed in a temporary shrine of cloth stretched over four
poles. On the appointed evening, rice is brought, and poured out in
front of the idol by the potter, and rice, gh&#299; (clarified butter),
and curds are poured on the top of it. The victims are then brought,
and their heads cut off by a washerman. The heads are placed on the
ground before the idol. The people then pour water on the heads, and
say &lsquo;speak&rsquo; (paluku). If the mouth opens, it is regarded as
a sign that the goddess is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>propitious. Next, a large pot of
boiled cholam (millet) is brought, and poured in a heap before the
image, a little further away than the rice. Two buffaloes are then
brought by the M&#257;las and M&#257;digas. One of the M&#257;las,
called the As&#257;di, chants the praises of the goddess during the
ceremony. The animals are killed by a M&#257;diga, by cutting their
throats with a knife, one being offered to Peddamma, and the other to
Chinnamma. Some of the cholam is then taken in baskets, and put under
the throat of the buffaloes till it is soaked with blood, and then put
aside. A M&#257;diga then cuts off the heads of the buffaloes with a
sword, and places them before the idol. He also cuts off one of the
forelegs of each, and puts it crosswise in the mouth. Some of the
cholam is then put on the two heads, and two small earthen saucers are
put upon it. The abdomens are then cut open, and some of the fat taken
out, melted, and put in each saucer with a lighted wick. A layer of fat
is spread over the eyes and mouths of the two heads, some of the refuse
of the stomach is mixed with the cholam soaked in blood, and a quantity
of margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves put over the cholam. The
As&#257;di then takes some of this mixture, and sprinkles it round the
shrine, saying &lsquo;Ko, bali,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>, accept the
sacrifice. Then the basket is given to another M&#257;la, who asks
permission from the village officials and ryots to sprinkle the cholam.
He also asks that a lamb may be killed. The lamb is killed by a
washerman, and the blood allowed to flow into the cholam in the basket.
The bowels of the lamb are taken out, and tied round the wrist of the
M&#257;la who holds the basket, and puts it round his neck. He then
goes and sprinkles the cholam mixed with blood, etc., in some cases
round the village, and in others before each house, shouting &lsquo;Ko,
bali&rsquo; as he goes. The people go in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>procession with him,
carrying swords and clubs to drive away evil spirits. During the
procession, limes are cut in half, and thrown into the air to
propitiate evil spirits. Other lambs are killed at intervals during the
course of the procession. In the afternoon, the carcases of the two
buffaloes offered the night before are taken away by the M&#257;las and
M&#257;digas. One is cut open, and some of the flesh cooked near the
shrine. Part of it, with some of the cholam offered before the images,
is given to five M&#257;la children, called Siddhulu, <i>i.e.</i>, holy
or sinless, who, in some cases, are covered with a cloth during the
meal. The rest is eaten by M&#257;las. The remainder of the carcases is
divided among the M&#257;las and M&#257;digas, who take it to their own
homes for a feast. The carcases of the lambs belong to the M&#257;las
and washermen. The carcase of the barren sheep is the perquisite of the
village officials, though the Kurnam, being a Br&#257;hmin, gives his
portion away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a festival to the village goddess which is held at Dowlaishweram
in the God&#257;vari district once every three years, a buffalo is
sacrificed. &ldquo;Votive offerings of pots of buttermilk are presented
to the goddess, who is taken outside the village, and the pots are
emptied there. The head of the buffalo and a pot of its blood are
carried round the village by a M&#257;la, and a pig is sacrificed in an
unusual and cruel manner. It is buried up to its neck, and cattle are
driven over it until it is trampled to death. This is supposed to
ensure the health of men and cattle in the ensuing
year.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4924src" href="#xd21e4924"
name="xd21e4924src">25</a></p>
<p>In connection with a village festival in the God&#257;vari district,
Bishop Whitehead writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4929src"
href="#xd21e4929" name="xd21e4929src">26</a> &ldquo;At Ellore, which is
a town of considerable size and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335"
href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>importance, I was told that
in the annual festival of Mah&#257;lakshmi about ten thousand animals
are killed in one day, rich people sending as many as twenty or thirty.
The blood then flows down into the fields behind the place of sacrifice
in a regular flood, and carts full of sand are brought to cover up what
remains on the spot. The heads are piled up in a heap about fifteen
feet high in front of the shrine, and a large earthen basin, about
1&frac12; feet in diameter, is then filled with gingelly oil and put on
the top of the heap, a thick cotton wick being placed in the basin and
lighted. The animals are all worshipped with the usual namaskaram
(folded hands raised to the forehead) before they are killed. This
slaughter of victims goes on all day, and at midnight about twenty or
twenty-five buffaloes are sacrificed, their heads being cut off by a
M&#257;diga p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest), and, together with the carcases,
thrown upon the large heaps of rice, which have been presented to the
goddess, till the rice is soaked with blood. The rice is collected in
about ten or fifteen large baskets, and is carried on a large cart
drawn by buffaloes or bullocks, with the M&#257;diga p&#363;j&#257;ri
seated on it. M&#257;digas sprinkle the rice along the streets and on
the walls of the houses, as the cart goes along, shouting poli, poli
(food). A large body of men of different castes, Pariahs and Sudras, go
with the procession, but only the M&#257;digas and M&#257;las (the two
sections of the Pariahs) shout poli, the rest following in silence.
They have only two or three torches to show them the way, and no
tom-toms or music. Apparently the idea is that, if they make a noise or
display a blaze of lights, they will attract the evil spirits, who will
swoop down on them and do them some injury, though in other villages it
is supposed that a great deal of noise and flourishing of sticks will
keep the evil spirits at bay. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336"
href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>Before the procession starts,
the heads of the buffaloes are put in front of the shrine, with the
right forelegs in their mouths, and the fat from the entrails smeared
about half an inch thick over the whole face, and a large earthen lamp
on the top of each head. The Pambalas play tom-toms, and chant a long
story about Gangamma till daybreak, and about 8 <span class=
"sc">A.M.</span> they put the buffalo heads into separate baskets with
the lighted lamps upon them, and these are carried in procession
through the town to the sound of tom-toms. All castes follow, shouting
and singing. In former times, I was told, there was a good deal of
fighting and disturbance during this procession, but now the police
maintain order. When the procession arrives at the municipal limits,
the heads are thrown over the boundary, and left there. The people then
all bathe in the canal, and return home. On the last day of the
festival, which, I may remark, lasts for about three months, a small
cart is made of margosa wood, and a stake fixed at each of the four
corners, and a pig and a fowl are tied to each stake, while a fruit,
called dubakaya, is impaled on it instead of the animal. A yellow
cloth, sprinkled with the blood of the buffaloes, is tied round the
sides of the cart, and some margosa leaves are tied round the cloth. A
Pambala sits on the cart, to which are fastened two large ropes, each
about 200 yards long. Then men of all castes, without distinction, lay
hold of the ropes, and drag the cart round the town to the sound of
tom-toms and music. Finally it is brought outside the municipal limits
and left there, the Pariahs taking away the animals and
fruits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following detailed account of the Peddamma or Sunkulamma
j&#257;tra (festival) in the Kurnool district, is given in the Manual.
&ldquo;This is a ceremony strictly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337"
href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>local, in which the entire
community of a village takes part, and which all outsiders are excluded
from participating in. It is performed whenever a series of crops
successively fail or cattle die in large numbers of murrain, and is
peculiarly adapted, by the horrible nature of the attendant rites and
the midnight hour chosen for the exhibition of its most ghastly scenes,
to impress the minds of an ignorant people with a belief in its
efficacy. When the celebration of the j&#257;tra is resolved on, a dark
Tuesday night is selected for it, and subscriptions are collected and
deposited with the Reddi (headman) or some respectable man in the
village. Messengers are sent off to give intimation of the day fixed
for the j&#257;tra to the Byn&#275;niv&#257;du, Bhutabalig&#257;du, and
Potur&#257;ju, three of the principal actors in the ceremony. At the
same time a buffalo is purchased, and, after having its horns painted
with saffron (turmeric) and adorned with margosa leaves, is taken round
the village in procession with tom-toms beating, and specially devoted
to the sacrifice of the goddess Peddamma or Sunkulamma on the morning
of the Tuesday on which the ceremony is to take place. The village
potter and carpenter are sent for, and ordered to have ready by that
evening two images of the goddess, one of clay and the other of juvi
wood, and a new cloth and a quantity of rice and dholl (peas:
<i>Cajanus indicus</i>) are given to each of them. When the images are
made, they are dressed with the new cloths, and the rice and dholl are
cooked and offered as naiv&#275;dyam to the images. In some villages
only one image, of clay, is made. Meanwhile the villagers are busy
erecting a pandal (booth) in front of the village ch&#257;vidi (caste
meeting-house), underneath which a small temple is erected of cholam
straw. The Byn&#275;niv&#257;du takes a handful of earth, and places it
inside this little temple, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338"
href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>the village washerman builds
a small pyal (dais) with it, and decorates it with rati (streaks of
different coloured powders). New pots are distributed by the potter to
the villagers, who, according to their respective capabilities, have a
large or small quantity of rice cooked in them, to be offered as
kumbham at the proper time. After dark, when these preparations are
over, the entire village community, including the twelve classes of
village servants, turn out in a body, and, preceded by the
Byn&#275;niv&#257;du and As&#257;divandlu, proceed in procession with
music playing to the house of the village potter. There the image of
the goddess is duly worshipped, and a quantity of raw rice is tied
round it with a cloth. A ram is sacrificed on the spot, and several
limes are cut and thrown away. Borne on the shoulders of the potter,
the image is then taken through the streets of the village,
Byn&#275;niv&#257;du and As&#257;divandlu dancing and capering all the
way, and the streets being drenched with the blood of several rams
sacrificed at every turning of the road, and strewed with hundreds of
limes cut and thrown away. The image is then finally deposited in the
temple of straw already referred to, and another sheep is sacrificed as
soon as this is done. The wooden image, made by the carpenter, is also
brought in with the same formalities, and placed by the side of the
image of clay. A pot of toddy is similarly brought in from the house of
the &#298;digav&#257;du (toddy-drawer), and set before the images. Now
the d&#275;varap&#333;tu, or buffalo specially devoted to the sacrifice
of the goddess, is led in from the Reddi&rsquo;s house in procession,
together with a sheep and a large pot of cooked rice. The rice in the
pot is emptied in front of the images and formed into a heap, which is
called the kumbham, and to it are added the contents of many new pots,
which the villagers have ready filled with cooked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>rice. The sheep is then sacrificed, and its
blood shed on the heap. Next comes the turn of the
d&#275;varap&#333;tu, the blood of which also, after it has been
killed, is poured over the rice heap. This is followed by the slaughter
of many more buffaloes and sheep by individuals of the community, who
might have taken vows to offer sacrifices to the goddess on this
occasion. While the carnage is going on, a strict watch is kept on all
sides, to see that no outsider enters the village, or steals away any
portion of the blood of the slaughtered animals, as it is believed that
all the benefit which the villagers hope to reap from the performance
of the j&#257;tra will be lost to them if an outsider should succeed in
taking away a little of the blood to his village. The sacrifice being
over, the head and leg of one of the slaughtered buffaloes are severed
from its body, and placed before the goddess with the leg inserted into
the mouth of the head. Over this head is placed a lighted lamp, which
is fed with oil and buffalo&rsquo;s fat. Now starts a fresh procession
to go round the village streets. A portion of the kumbham or
blood-stained rice heaped up before the image is gathered into two or
three baskets, and carried with the procession by washermen or
M&#257;digas. The Bhutabalig&#257;du now steps forward in a state of
perfect nudity, with his body clean shaven from top to toe, and smeared
all over with gore, and, taking up handfuls of rice (called poli) from
the baskets, scatters them broadcast over the streets. As the
procession passes on, bhutams or supernatural beings are supposed to
become visible at short distances to the carriers of the rice baskets,
who pretend to fall into trances, and, complaining of thirst, call for
more blood to quench it. Every time this happens, a fresh sheep is
sacrificed, and sometimes limes are cut and thrown in their way. The
main streets being thus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href=
"#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>sprinkled over with poli or
blood-stained rice, the lanes or gulleys are attended to by the
washermen of the village, who give them their share of the poli. By
this time generally the day dawns, and the goddess is brought back to
her straw temple, where she again receives offerings of cooked rice
from all classes of people in the village, Br&#257;hmins downwards. All
the while, the As&#257;divandlu keep singing and dancing before the
goddess. As the day advances, a pig is half buried at the entrance of
the village, and all the village cattle are driven over it. The cattle
are sprinkled over with poli as they pass over the pig. The
Potur&#257;ju then bathes and purifies himself, and goes to the temple
of Lingamayya or Siva with tom-toms and music, and sacrifices a sheep
there. The j&#257;tra ends with another grand procession, in which the
images of the goddess, borne on the heads of the village potter and
carpenter, are carried to the outskirts of the village, where they are
left. As the villagers return home, they pull to pieces the straw
temple constructed in front of the ch&#257;vidi, and each man takes
home a straw, which he preserves as a sacred relic. From the day the
ceremony is commenced in the village till its close, no man would go to
a neighbouring village, or, if he does on pressing business, he would
return to sleep in his own village. It is believed that the performance
of this j&#257;tra will ensure prosperity and health to the villagers
and their cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The origin of this Sunkulamma j&#257;tra is based on the
following legend, which is sung by the Byn&#275;ni and As&#257;divandlu
when they dance before the images. Sunkulamma was the only daughter of
a learned Br&#257;hmin pandit, who occasionally took pupils, and
instructed them in the Hindu shastras gratuitously. One day, a handsome
youth of sixteen years came to the pandit, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>and,
announcing himself as the son of a Br&#257;hmin of Benares come in
quest of knowledge, requested that he might be enlisted as a pupil of
the pandit. The pandit, not doubting the statement of the youth that he
was a Br&#257;hmin, took him as a pupil, and lodged him in his own
house. The lad soon displayed marks of intelligence, and, by close
application to his studies, made such rapid progress that he became the
principal favourite of his master, who was so much pleased with him
that, at the close of his studies, he married him to his daughter
Sunkulamma. The unknown youth stayed with his father-in-law till he
became father of some children, when he requested permission to return
to his native place with his wife and children, which was granted, and
he accordingly started on his homeward journey. On the way he met a
party of M&#257;la people, who, recognising him at once as a man of
their own caste and a relation, accosted him, and began to talk to him
familiarly. Finding it impossible to conceal the truth from his wife
any longer, the husband of Sunkulamma confessed to her that he was a
Mala by caste, and, being moved by a strong desire to learn the Hindu
shastras, which he was forbidden to read, he disguised himself as a
Br&#257;hmin youth, and introduced himself to her father and compassed
his object; and, as what had been done in respect to her could not be
undone, the best thing she could do was to stay with him with her
children. Sunkulamma, however, was not to be so persuaded. Indignant at
the treachery practiced on her and her parent, she spurned both her
husband and children, and returning to her village, sent for her
parent, whose house she would not pollute by going in, and asked him
what he would do with a pot denied by the touch of a dog. The father
replied that he would commit it to the flames <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>to
purify it. Taking the hint, she caused a funeral pile to be erected,
and committed suicide by throwing herself into the flames. But, before
doing so, she cursed the treacherous M&#257;la who bad polluted her
that he might become a buffalo, and his children turn into sheep, and
vowed she would revive as an evil spirit, and have him and his children
sacrificed to her, and get his leg put into his mouth, and a light
placed on his head fed with his own fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following additional information in connection with the
j&#257;tra may be recorded. In some places, on a Tuesday fifteen days
before the festival, some M&#257;las go in procession through the main
streets of the village without any noise or music. This is called
m&#363;gi ch&#257;tu (dumb announcement). On the following Tuesday, the
M&#257;las go through the streets, beating tom-toms, and proclaiming
the forthcoming ceremony. This is called ch&#257;tu (announcement). In
some villages, metal idols are used. The image is usually in the
custody of a Ts&#257;kala (washerman). On the j&#257;tra day, he brings
it fully decorated, and sets it up on the Gangamma mitta
(Gangamma&rsquo;s dais). In some places, this is a permanent structure,
and in others put up for the j&#257;tra at a fixed spot.
&#256;s&#257;dis, Pambalas, and Bain&#275;dus, and M&#257;diga Kommula
v&#257;ndlu (horn-blowers) dance and sing until the goddess is lifted
up from the dais, when a number of burning torches are collected
together, and some resinous material is thrown into the flames. At the
same time, a cock is killed, and waved in front of the goddess by the
Ts&#257;kala. A mark is made with the blood on the forehead of the
idol, which is removed to a hut constructed by M&#257;las with twigs of
margosa (<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>), <i>Eugenia Jambolana</i> and
<i>Vitex Negundo</i>. In some villages, when the goddess is brought in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>procession to the outskirts of the village, a
stick is thrown down in front of her. The &#256;s&#257;dis then sing
songs, firstly of a most obscene character, and afterwards in praise of
the goddess.</p>
<p>The following account of &ldquo;the only M&#257;la ascetic in
Bharatavarsha&rdquo; (India) is given by Mr. M. N. Vincent.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4973src" href="#xd21e4973" name=
"xd21e4973src">27</a> The ascetic was living on a hill in Bezw&#257;da,
at the foot of which lay the hamlets of the M&#257;las. The man,
Govindoo by name, &ldquo;was a groom in the employ of a Muhammadan
Inspector of Police, and he was commissioned on one occasion to take a
horse to a certain town. He was executing his commission, when, on the
way, and not far from his destination, the animal shied and fell into
the Krishna river, and was swept along the current, and poor Govindoo
could not help it. But, knowing the choleric temper of his employer,
and in order to avoid a scolding, he roamed at large, and eventually
fell in with a company of S&#257;dhus, one of whose disciples he
became, and practiced austerities, though not for the full term, and
settled eventually on the hill where we saw him occupying the old cave
dwelling of a former S&#257;dhu. It appears that there was something
earthly in the man, S&#257;dhu though he was, as was evidenced from his
relations with a woman votary or disciple, and it was probably because
of this phase of his character that some people regarded him as a cheat
and a rogue. But this unfavourable impression was soon removed, and,
since the time he slept on a bed of sharp thorns, as it were in
vindication of his character, faulty though it had been, he has been
honoured. A good trait in the man should be mentioned, namely, that he
wrote to his parents to give his wife in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>marriage to some one
else, as he had renounced his worldly ties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At V&#257;nav&#333;lu, in the Hindup&#363;r t&#257;luk of the
Anantap&#363;r district, there is a temple to Rangasw&#257;mi, at which
the p&#363;jari (priest) is a M&#257;la. People of the upper castes
frequent it, but do their own p&#363;ja, the M&#257;la standing aside
for the time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4980src" href="#xd21e4980"
name="xd21e4980src">28</a></p>
<p>It is noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1891, that the chief
object of worship by the Balijas is Gauri, their caste deity. &ldquo;It
is said that the M&#257;las are the hereditary custodians of the idol
of Gauri and her jewels, which the Balijas get from them whenever they
want to worship her. The following story is told to account for this.
The K&#257;pus and the Balijas, molested by the Muhammadan invaders on
the north of the river Penn&#257;r, migrated to the south when the
Penn&#257;r was in full flood. Being unable to cross the river, they
invoked their deity to make a passage for them, for which it demanded
the sacrifice of a first-born child. While they stood at a loss what to
do, the M&#257;las, who followed them, boldly offered one of their
children to the goddess. Immediately the river divided before them, and
the K&#257;pus and the Balijas crossed it, and were saved from the
tyranny of the Muhammadans. Ever since that time, the M&#257;las have
been respected by the K&#257;pus and Balijas, and the latter even
deposited the images of Gauri, the bull and Gan&#275;sa, which they
worshipped in the house of a M&#257;la. I am credibly informed that the
practice of leaving these images in the custody of M&#257;las is even
now observed in some parts of Cuddapah district and
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expert M&#257;la medicine-man has been known to prescribe for a
Br&#257;hman tahsildar (revenue officer), <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>though the
consultation was conducted at a most respectful distance on the part of
the honoured physician.</p>
<p>M&#257;la weavers are known as Netpanivandlu (Nethapani, weaving
work). According to the Census Report, 1891, the sub-divisions of the
M&#257;las, which are numerically strongest, are Arava, Kanta,
Murikin&#257;du, P&#257;kan&#257;ti, and Reddi Bh&#363;mi. To these may
be added Sarindla, S&#257;vu, S&#257;indla, and D&#257;indla.
Concerning some of these divisions, the following legend is current. A
M&#257;la married eighteen wives, one from each kulam or tribal
division. The god Poleramma, objecting to the sacrifice of sheep and
goats, wanted him to offer up a woman and child in substitution for the
animals, and the M&#257;la broke the news to his wives, one of whom
eloped with a Reddi, and gave origin to the Reddi Bh&#363;mis
(bh&#363;mi, earth). Another ran away, and gave rise to the
P&#257;kan&#257;tis (eastern country). A third hid herself, and escaped
by hiding. Hence her descendants are called D&#257;indla v&#257;ndlu,
concerning whom there is a proverb &ldquo;Dagipoyina v&#257;ndlu
D&#257;indla v&#257;ndlu&rdquo; or &ldquo;Those who escaped by hiding
are D&#257;indlas.&rdquo; One of the wives, who fled to the forest,
found her way out by clearing the jungle, and her descendants are
called Sarindla (straight). The wife who consented to be sacrificed
with her child was restored to life by Poleramma, and gave rise to the
S&#257;vu (death) or S&#257;indla (belonging to a death house) section.
The D&#257;indlas are said to be Tamil Paraiyans, who settled down in
the Telugu country, and adopted the manners and customs of the
M&#257;las. Some call themselves Arava (Tamil) M&#257;las. They are
employed as servants in European houses, horse-keepers, etc.</p>
<p>In connection with the origin of the M&#257;las, the Rev. S.
Nicholson writes as follows. &ldquo;Originally the M&#257;las belonged
to the kudi paita section of the community, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span><i>i.e.</i>, their women wore the cloth over the
right shoulder, but now there are both right and left paita sections,
and this must be taken as the principal division. The right-hand (right
paita) section is again divided into (<i>a</i>) Reddi Bh&#363;malavaru,
(<i>b</i>) P&#333;kun&#257;tivaru. The left-hand (left paita) section
are Murikin&#257;tivaru. The following legend professes to account for
the existence of the three divisions. When V&#299;rabahuvu went to the
rescue of Harischandra, he promised K&#257;li that, if she granted him
success, he would sacrifice to her his wives, of whom he had three.
Accordingly, after his conquest of Vishvamithrudu, he returned, and
called his wives that he might take them to the temple in order to
fulfil his vow. The wives got some inkling of what was in store for
them, and one of them took refuge in the house of a Reddi Bh&#363;mala,
another ran away to the eastern country (P&#333;kun&#257;ti), while the
third, though recently confined, and still in her dirty (muriki) cloth,
determined to abide by the wish of her lord. She was, therefore,
sacrificed to K&#257;li, but the goddess, seeing her devotion, restored
her to life, and promised to remain for ever her helper. The reason
given for the change in the method of wearing the cloth is that, after
the incident described above took place, the women of the
Murikin&#257;ti section, in order to express their disapproval of the
two unfaithful wives, began to wear their cloths on the opposite, viz.,
the left, shoulder. In marriages, however, whatever the paita of the
bride, she must wear the cloth over the right shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Reddi Bh&#363;malu and P&#333;kun&#257;tiv&#257;ru say
that the reason they wear the cloth over the right shoulder is that
they are descendants of the gods. According to a legend, the goddess
Parvati, whilst on a journey with her lord Param&#275;shvarudu,
discarded one of her unclean <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href=
"#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>(maila) cloths, from which was
born a little boy. This boy was engaged as a cattle-herd in the house
of Param&#275;shvarudu. Parvati received strict injunctions from her
lord that she should on no account allow the little M&#257;la to taste
cream. One day, however, the boy discovered some cream which had been
scraped from the inside of the pot sticking to a wall. He tasted it,
and found it good. Indeed, so good was it that he came to the
conclusion that the udder from which it came must be even better still.
So one day, in order to test his theory, he killed the cow. Then came
Param&#275;shvarudu in great anger, and asked him what he had done,
and, to his credit be it said, the boy told the truth. Then
Param&#275;shvarudu cursed the lad and all his descendants, and said

<p>Concerning the home of the M&#257;las, Mr. Nicholson writes that
&ldquo;the houses (with mud or stone walls, roofed with thatch or
palmyra palm leaves) are almost invariably placed quite apart from the
village proper. Gradually, as the caste system and fear of defilement
become less, so gradually the distance of their houses from the village
is becoming less. In the Ceded Districts, where from early times every
village was surrounded by a wall and moat, the aloofness of the houses
is very apparent. Gradually, however, the walls are decaying, and the
moats are being filled, and the physical separation of the outcaste
classes is becoming less apparent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholson writes further that &ldquo;according to their own
traditions, as told still by the old people and the religious
mendicants, in former times the M&#257;las were a tribe of free lances,
who, &lsquo;like the tiger, slept during the day, and worked at
night.&rsquo; They were evidently the paid mercenaries of the Poligars
(feudal chiefs), and carried out raids and committed robberies for the
lord <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>under whose protection they were. That this
tradition has some foundation may be gathered from the fact that many
of the house-names of the M&#257;las refer to weapons of war,
<i>e.g.</i>, spear, drum, etc. If reports are true, the old instinct is
not quite dead, and even to-day a cattle-stealing expedition comes not
amiss to some. The M&#257;las belong to the subjugated race, and have
been made into the servants of the community. Very probably, in former
days, their services had to be rendered for nothing, but later certain
in&#257;m (rent-free) lands were granted, the produce of which was
counted as remuneration for service rendered. Originally, these lands
were held quite free of taxation, but, since the advent of the British
R&#257;j, the village servants have all been paid a certain sum per
month, and, whilst still allowed the enjoyment of their in&#257;m
lands, they have now been assessed, and half the actual tax has to be
paid to Government. The services rendered by the M&#257;las are temple
service, j&#257;tra or festival service, and village service. The
village service consists of sweeping, scavenging, carrying burdens, and
grave-digging, the last having been their perquisite for long ages.
According to them, the right was granted to them by King Harischandra
himself. The burial-grounds are supposed to belong to the M&#257;las,
and the site of a grave must be paid for, the price varying according
to the position and wealth of the deceased, but I hear that, in our
part of the country, the price does not often exceed two pence. Though
the Br&#257;hmans do not bury, yet they must pay a fee of one rupee for
the privilege of burning, besides the fee for carrying the body to the
gh&#257;t. There is very little respect shown by the M&#257;las at the
burning-gh&#257;t, and the fuel is thrown on with jokes and laughter.
The M&#257;las dig graves for all castes which bury, except
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>Muhammadans, Odd&#275;s, and M&#257;digas. Not
only on the day of burial, but afterwards on the two occasions of the
ceremonies for the dead, the grave-diggers must be given food and
drink. The M&#257;las are also used as death messengers to relatives by
all the S&#363;dra castes. When on this work, the messenger must not on
any account go to the houses of his relatives though they live in the
village to which he has been sent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief occupations of the M&#257;las are weaving, and
working as farm labourers for S&#363;dras; a few cultivate their own
land. Though formerly their in&#257;m lands were extensive, they have
been, in the majority of cases, mortgaged away. The M&#257;las of the
western part of the Telugu country are of a superior type to those of
the east, and they have largely retained their lands, and, in some
cases, are well-to-do cultivators. In the east, weaving is the staple
industry, and it is still carried on with the most primitive
instruments. In one corner of a room stands the loom, with a hole in
the mud floor to receive the treadles, and a little window in the wall,
level with the floor, lights the web. The loom itself is slung from the
rafters, and the whole can be folded up and put away in a corner. As a
rule, weaving lasts for eight months of the year, the remainder of the
year being occupied in reaping and stacking crops, etc. Each weaver has
his own customers, and very often one family of M&#257;las will have
weaved for one family of S&#363;dras for generations. Before starting
to weave, the weaver worships his loom, and rubs his shuttle on his
nose, which is supposed to make it smooth. Those who cannot weave
subsist by day labour. As a rule, they stick to one master, and are
engaged in cultivation all the year round. Many, having borrowed money
from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>some S&#363;dra, are bound to work for him for a
mere pittance, and that in grain, not cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on a visit to Jammalamadugu in the Cuddapah district,
Bishop Whitehead writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5186src"
href="#xd21e5186" name="xd21e5186src">29</a> &ldquo;Lately Mr. Macnair
has made an effort to improve the methods of weaving, and he showed us
some looms that he had set up in his compound to teach the people the
use of a cheap kind of fly-shuttle to take the place of the
hand-shuttle which is universally used by the people. The difficulties
he has met with are characteristic of many attempts to improve on the
customs and methods of India. At present the thread used for the
hand-shuttle is spun by the M&#257;la women from the ordinary cotton
produced in the district. The M&#257;la weavers do not provide their
own cotton for the clothes they weave, but the K&#257;pus give them the
cotton from their own fields, pay the women a few annas for spinning
it, and then pay the men a regular wage for weaving it into cloth. But
the cotton spun in the district is not strong enough for the
fly-shuttle, which can only be profitably worked with mill-made thread.
The result is that, if the fly-shuttle were generally adopted, it would
leave no market for the native cotton, throw the women out of work,
upset the whole system on which the weavers work, and, in fact, produce
widespread misery and confusion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following detailed account of the ceremonies in connection with
marriage, many of which are copied from the higher Telugu castes, is
given by Mr. Nicholson. &ldquo;Chinna T&#257;mb&#363;lam (little betel)
is the name given to the earliest arrangements for a future wedding.
The parents of the boy about to be married enquire of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>Br&#257;hman to which quarter they should go in
search of a bride. He, after receiving his pay, consults the
boy&rsquo;s horoscope, and then tells them that in a certain quarter
there is loss, in another quarter there is death, but that in another
quarter there is gain or good. If in the quarter which the Br&#257;hman
has intimated as good there are relations, so much the better; the
bride will be sought amongst them. If not, the parents of the youth,
along with an elder of the caste, set out in search of a bride amongst
new people. On reaching the village, they do not make their object
known, but let it appear that they are on ordinary business. Having
discovered a house in which there is a marriageable girl, after the
ordinary salutations, they, in a round-about way, make enquiries as to
whether the warasa or marriage line is right or not. If it is all
right, and if at that particular time the girl&rsquo;s people are in a
prosperous condition, the object of the search is made known. If, on
the other hand, the girl&rsquo;s people are in distress or grief, the
young man&rsquo;s party go away without making their intention known.
Everything being satisfactory, betel nut and leaves are offered, and,
if the girl&rsquo;s people are willing to contract, they accept it; if
not, and they refuse, the search has to be resumed. We will take it for
granted that the betel is accepted. The girl&rsquo;s parents then say
&lsquo;If it is God&rsquo;s will, so let it be; return in eight or nine
days, and we will give you our answer.&rsquo; If, within that time,
there should be death or trouble of any sort in either of the houses,
all arrangements are abandoned. If, when going to pay the second visit,
on the journey any of the party should drop on the way either staff or
bundle of food, it is regarded as a bad omen, and further progress is
stopped for that day. After reaching the house of the prospective bride
on the second occasion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>the party wait outside. Should the
parents of the girl bring out water for them to drink and to wash their
faces, it is a sign that matters may be proceeded with. Betel is again
distributed. In the evening, the four parents and the elders talk
matters over, and, if all is so far satisfactory, they promise to come
to the house of the future bridegroom on a certain date. The
boy&rsquo;s parents, after again distributing betel, this time to every
house of the caste, take their departure. When the party of the bride
arrive at the boy&rsquo;s village, they are treated to toddy and a good
feed, after which they give their final promise. Then, having made
arrangements for the Pedda T&#257;mb&#363;lam (big betel), they take
their departure. This ends the first part of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5195" title="Source: negociations">negotiations</span>. Chinna
T&#257;mb&#363;lam is not binding. The second part of the negociations,
which is called Pedda T&#257;mb&#363;lam, takes place at the home of
the future bride. Before departing for the ceremony, the party of the
bridegroom, which must be an odd number but not seven, and some of the
elders of the village, take part in a feast. The members of the party
put on their religious marks, daub their necks and faces with sandal
paste and akshinthulu (coloured rice), and are sent off with the good
wishes of the villagers. After the party has gone some few miles, it is
customary for them to fortify themselves with toddy, and to distribute
betel. The father of the groom takes with him as a present for the
bride a bodice, fried dal (pea: <i>Cajanus indicus</i>), cocoanut,
rice, jaggery, turmeric, dates, gh&#299;, etc. On arrival at the house,
the party wait outside, until water is brought for their faces and
feet. After the stains of travel have been washed off, the presents are
given, and the whole assembly proceeds to the toddy shop. On their
return, the Chalav&#257;dhi (caste servant) tells <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>them
to which households betel must be presented, after which the real
business commences. The party of the bridegroom, the people of the
bride, the elders of the caste, and one person from each house in the
caste quarter, are present. A blanket is spread on the floor, and
grains of rice are arranged on it according to a certain pattern. This
is the bridal throne. After bathing, the girl is arrayed in an old
cloth, and seated on a weaver&rsquo;s beam placed upon the blanket,
with her face towards the east. Before seating herself, however, she
must worship towards the setting sun. In her open hands betel is
placed, along with the dowry (usually about sixteen rupees) brought by
her future father-in-law. As the bride sits thus upon the throne, the
respective parents question one another, the bride&rsquo;s parents as
to the groom, what work he does, what jewels he will give, etc.
Whatever other jewels are given or not, the groom is supposed to give a
necklace of silver and beads, and a gold nose jewel. As these things
are being talked over, some one winds 101 strands of thread, without
twisting it, into a circle about the size of a necklace, and then ties
on it a peculiar knot. After smearing with turmeric, it is given into
the hands of the girl&rsquo;s maternal uncle, who, while holding his
hands full of betel, asks first the girl&rsquo;s parents, and then the
whole community if there is any objection to the match. If all agree,
he must then worship the bridal throne, and, without letting any of the
betel in his hands fall, place the necklace round the bride&rsquo;s
neck. Should any of the betel fall, it is looked upon as a very bad
omen, and the man is fined. After this part of the performance is over,
and after teasing the bride, the uncle raises her to her feet, and,
taking from her hands the dowry, etc., sends her off. After
distributing betel to every one in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb355" href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>village, even unborn
babies being counted, the ceremony ends, and, after the usual feast has
been partaken of, the people all depart to their various homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wedding, contrary to the previous ceremonies, takes place
at the home of the bridegroom. A Br&#257;hman is asked to tell a day on
which the omens are favourable, for which telling he receives a small
fee. A few days before the date foretold, the house is cleaned, the
floor cow-dunged, and the walls are whitewashed. In order that the evil
eye may be warded off, two marks are made, one on each side of the
door, with oil and charcoal mixed. Then the clothes of the bride and
bridegroom are made ready. These, as a rule, are yellow and white, but
on no account must there be any indigo in them, as that would be a sign
of death. The grain and betel required for the feast, a toe-ring for
the bridegroom, and a t&#257;li (marriage badge) for the bride, are
then purchased. The toe-ring is worn on the second toe of the right
foot, and the t&#257;li, which is usually about the size of a sixpence,
is worn round the woman&rsquo;s neck. The goldsmith is paid for these
not only in coin, but also in grain and betel, after receiving which he
blesses the jewels he has made, and presents them to the people.
Meanwhile, messengers have been sent, with the usual presents, to the
bride&rsquo;s people and friends, to inform them that the auspicious
day has been fixed, and bidding them to the ceremony. In all
probability, before the preparations mentioned above are complete, all
the money the bridegroom&rsquo;s people have saved will be expended.
But there is seldom any difficulty in obtaining a loan. It is
considered an act of great merit to advance money for a wedding, and
people of other and richer castes are quite ready to lend the amount
required. In former days, it was customary to give these loans free of
interest, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>but it is not so now. The next item is the
preparation of the pandal or bower. This is generally erected a day or
two before the actual marriage in front of the house. It consists of
four posts, one at each corner, and the roof is thatched with the straw
of large millet. All round are hung garlands of mango leaves, and
cocoanut leaves are tied to the four posts. On the left side of the
house door is planted a branch of a tree (<i>Nerium odorum</i>), to
which is attached the kankanam made in the following way. A woollen
thread and a cotton thread are twisted together, and to them are tied a
copper finger-ring, a piece of turmeric root, and a betel leaf. The
tree mentioned is watered every day, until the whole of the marriage
ceremonies are completed. As a rule, the whole of the work in
connection with the erection of the pandal is carried out by the
elders, who receive in payment food and toddy. At this time, also, the
fire-places for the cooking of the extra amount of food are prepared.
These are simply trenches dug in the mud floor of the house, usually
three in number. Before they are dug, a cocoanut is broken, and offered
over the spot. A journey is now made to the potter&rsquo;s for the pots
required in the cooking of the marriage feast. This in itself is quite
a ceremony. A canopy is formed of an ordinary wearing cloth supported
at its four corners by four men, whilst a boy with a long stick pushes
it into a tent shape in the middle. Beneath the canopy is one of the
women of the bridegroom&rsquo;s family, who carries on a tray two
sacred lamps, an eight-anna piece, some saffron (turmeric),
akshinthulu, betel, frankincense, cocoanut, etc. On arriving at the
potter&rsquo;s house, the required pots are placed in a row outside,
and a cocoanut, which has been held in the smoke of the incense, is
broken into two equal parts, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357"
href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>two halves being placed on
the ground about a yard apart. To these all the people do p&#363;ja
(worship), and then take up the pots, and go home. The eight-anna piece
is given to the potter, and the betel to the Chalav&#257;dhi. On the
way to the potter&rsquo;s, and on the return thence, the procession is
accompanied with music, and the women sing songs. Meanwhile, the groom,
and those who have remained at home, have been worshipping the goddess
Sunkalamma. The method of making this goddess, and its worship, are as
follows. Rice and green gram are cooked together, and with this cooked
food a cone is made minus the point. A little hollow is made on the
top, and this is filled with gh&#299; (clarified butter), onions, and
dal. Four wicks are put into it, so forming a lamp. A nose jewel is
stuck somewhere on the outside of the lump, two garlands are placed
round it, and the whole is decorated with religious marks. This goddess
is always placed in the north-east corner of the house, called the
god&rsquo;s corner, which has been previously cleaned, and an image of
Hanum&#257;n, or some other deity, is drawn with rice-powder on the
floor. Upon this drawing the image of Sunkalamma is placed. Before her
are put several little balls of rice, with which gh&#299; has been
mixed. The worship consists in making offerings of frankincense and
camphor, and a cocoanut, which is broken in half, the halves being put
in front of the goddess. A ram or a he-goat is now brought, n&#299;m
(<i>Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves are tied round the horns, religious
marks are made on the forehead, water is placed in its mouth, and it is
then sacrificed. After the sacrifice has been made, those assembled
prostrate themselves before the image for some time in silence, after
which they go outside for a minute or two, and then, returning, divide
the goddess, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>and eat it. The groom now has his head shaved,
and the priest cuts his finger and toe nails, eyelashes, etc. The
cuttings are placed, along with a quarter of a rupee which he has kept
in his mouth during the process, in an old winnowing tray, with a
little lamp made of rice, betel and grain. The priest, facing west and
with the bridegroom in front of him, makes three passes with the tray
from the head to the foot. This is supposed to take away the evil eye.
The priest then takes the tray away, all the people getting out of the
way lest the blight should come on them. He throws away what is
useless, but keeps the rest, especially the quarter of a rupee. After
this little ceremony, the future husband takes a bath, but still keeps
on his old clothes. He is given a knife, with which to keep away
devils, and is garlanded with the garlands which were round the
goddess. His toe-ring is put on, and the next ceremony, the
propitiation of the dead, is proceeded with. The sacrificed animal is
dismembered, and the bones, flesh, and intestines are put into separate
pots, and cooked. Rice also is prepared, and placed in a heap, to which
the usual offerings are made. Then rice, and some of the flesh from
each pot, is placed upon two leaf plates. These are left before the
heap of rice, with two lamps burning. The people all salute the rice,
and proceed to eat it. The rice on the two plates is reserved for
members of the family. By this time, the bride has most likely arrived
in the village, but, up to this stage, will have remained in a separate
house. She does not come to the feast mentioned above, but has a
portion of food sent to her by the bridegroom&rsquo;s people. After the
feast, bride and bridegroom are each anointed in their separate houses
with nalugu (uncooked rice and turmeric). When the anointing of the
bride takes place, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359"
name="pb359">359</a>]</span>the groom sends to her a cloth, a bodice,
cocoanut, pepper and garlic. The bride leaves her parents&rsquo; house,
dressed in old clothes. Her people provide only a pair of sandals, and
two small toe-rings. She also carries a fair quantity of rice in the
front fold of her cloth. Again a procession is formed as before for the
cooking-pots, and another visit is paid to the potter&rsquo;s house,
but, on this occasion, in place of eight annas grain is taken. The
potter presents them with two wide-mouthed pots, and four small-mouthed
pots, two of which are decorated in four colours. As before, these are
placed in a row outside, and again the party, after worshipping them,
takes them to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house. These pots are supposed to
represent Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and, as they are being
carried to the house, no pregnant woman or mother with small children
should meet them, or they will have trouble. On arriving at the house,
and before entering, a cock is sacrificed, and a cocoanut offered. [In
some places, a goat is killed in front of the room in which the
marriage pots are kept, and marks are made with the palms of the hands
covered with the blood on the side-walls of the entrance.] Water is
sprinkled on the door step, and the pots are taken inside. During the
whole of the above performance, the pots are held in the hands, and
must not be put down. After entering the house, grain is spread on the
floor in the north-east corner, and upon this are placed the pots, one
upon the other, in two or four rows. The topmost pot is covered with a
lid, and on the lid is placed a lighted lamp. From the beams exactly
above the lamps are suspended, to which are fastened small bundles
containing dates, cocoanut, jaggery, sugar, and saffron. Round each pot
is tied a kankanam (wrist-thread). These pots are worshipped every day
as long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>as the wedding ceremonies last, which is usually
three days. Not only so, but the lamps are kept continually burning,
and there is betel arranged in a brass pot in the form of a lotus ever
before them. Beneath the pandal is now arranged a throne exactly
similar to the one which was used on the occasion of the Pedda
T&#257;mb&#363;lam. Until now the bride has kept to her separate house,
but she now dresses in her new clothes. Putting on the sandals she
brought from her own home, she proceeds to the house of the bridegroom.
There she waits in the pandal for her future husband, who comes out
dressed in his wedding garments, wearing his sandals, and carrying a
blanket, g&#333;chi,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5225src" href=
"#xd21e5225" name="xd21e5225src">30</a> shoulder-cloth, and knife. Both
bride and bridegroom now have fastened on to their foreheads a kind of
philactery or nuptial crown called bh&#257;singalu. They are also
garlanded with flowers, in addition to which the bridegroom has tied on
to his wrists the kankanam. In order that the two most intimately
concerned persons may not see one another (and up to this point they
have not done so), a screen is erected, the bride standing on one side,
and the bridegroom on the other. As a rule, they each of them keep
their heads bent during the whole of the proceedings, and look as
miserable as possible. Indeed, it would be a breach of etiquette for
either of them to appear as though they were enjoying the ceremony.
Except for the screen, the two are now face to face, the groom looking
towards the east, and the bride towards the west. Upon the bridal
throne there is now placed for the bride to stand upon a basket filled
with grain, and for the groom the beam of a loom. The screen is now
taken away, and the priest, a D&#257;sari, asks <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>whether the elders, the M&#257;la people
generally, and the village as a whole, are in favour of the marriage.
This he asks three times. Probably, in former times, it was possible to
stop a marriage at this point, but now it is never done, and the
marriage is practically binding after Pedda T&#257;mb&#363;lam has been
gone through. Indeed, in hard times, if the bride is of marriageable
age, the couple will live together as man and wife, putting off the
final ceremony until times are better. The groom now salutes the
priest, the bride places her foot on the weaving beam, and the groom
places his foot upon that of the woman as a token of his present and
continued lordship. After this, the bride also is invested with the
kankanam. After the groom has worshipped the four quarters of heaven,
the priest, who holds in his hands a brass vessel of milk, hands the
golden marriage token to the groom, who ties it round the bride&rsquo;s
neck. This is the first time during the ceremony that either of them
has looked on the other. Before the groom ties the knot, he must ask
permission from the priest and people three times. The priest now dips
a twig of the jivi tree (<i>Ficus Tsiela</i>) into the milk, and hands
it to the husband, who, crossing his hands over his wife&rsquo;s head,
allows some of the drops to fall upon her. The wife then does the same
to the husband. After this, the rice which the bride brought with her
in her lap is used in a similar blessing. The priest, holding in his
hand a gold jewel, now takes the hands of the two in his, and repeats
several passages (charms). Whoever wishes may now shower the pair with
rice, and, after that is done, the priest publicly announces them to be
man and wife. But the ceremonies are not yet ended. The newly-married
pair, and all the assembled party, now proceed to the village shrine to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>worship the god. Before doing so, the cloths of
the newly-wed pair are tied together by the priest. This knot is called
the Brahma knot, and is a sign that God had ordained the two to be man
and wife even in a previous birth. After the god has been worshipped,
and an offering of betel made to the four quarters, the party return to
the house accompanied by weird music and much tom-tom. The women, as a
rule, sing wedding songs, and the husband and wife are shaded by a
canopy. Arrived at the threshold of the house, the fear of the evil eye
is made the reason for another ceremony. Before either crosses the
threshold, passes are made from their head to their feet with black and
red water. On the threshold is placed a brass bowl full of grain, upon
which is a gold nose jewel. The man and woman must each touch this with
the right foot, after which they may enter the house without fear.
After entering the house, the evil eye is again removed, this time with
a cocoanut, which is afterwards thrown away. Those who have unlucky
twists of hair must at this time, besides the above ceremony, sacrifice
a goat. After entering the house, the whole party worship Lakshmi. Long
ago, the tradition runs, this goddess was very gracious to the
M&#257;las, and, in consequence, they were wealthy and prosperous. One
day, however, Lakshmi went up to one of the chief men, who at that time
was very busy at work upon a web of cloth, and began to make love to
him. At any other time this would have been very acceptable, but just
then, being very busy, he asked the goddess to go away. She, however,
took no notice, and only bothered him the more. Whereupon, losing his
temper, he hit her over the head with the heavy sizing brush which he
was using. This hurt the feelings of Lakshmi to such an extent that she
left the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>M&#257;las, withdrew her favour, and transferred
it to the K&#333;matis. Since then, the M&#257;las have been poor. The
husband next dips his hands into a plate of milk three times, each time
placing his wet hand on the wall. After him, the bride does the same.
The two then, sitting down, eat rice and milk off one plate. This is
the first and only time that husband and wife eat together. The
b&#257;shingams are now taken off, and the wife is relieved from the
burden of rice she has thus far carried in her lap. The next ceremony
is called the Bh&#363;malu, and is a feast for the husband, his wife,
and blood relations only. Not more than ten, and not less than six must
partake, and these must all be husbands or wives, <i>i.e.</i>, the
party must consist of either three or five couples. The feast consists
of the most expensive food the people can afford, and is eaten on two
consecutive days. A blanket is spread on the floor, and on this raw
rice is placed in a cloth, with betel leaves arranged in the form of a
lotus at the four corners. Here and there are placed red rice, sandal,
and turmeric, and a new lamp is lit. Three children are brought in, and
are made to stand before the rice. The parties who are to partake now
come in couples, and one of the children ties upon their wrists the
kankanam, another daubs them with sandal paste, and another with red
rice. The food is placed on two plates, one for the women and one for
the males. All the women sit round the one, and the men round the
other. Whilst eating, they must not drop a single grain. Should they do
so, it is not only unlucky, but is also the cause of serious quarrels,
and the fault is punishable with a heavy fine. After the feast is over,
the heap of rice is worshipped, and the children are sent off with a
little present each. The pair are again anointed with nalugu. This is
done twice every day for three days, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb364" href="#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>but no widow is
allowed to do it. Before anointing, the people about to do it must
present a cocoanut and jaggery. When the cocoanut and jaggery are
given, they must be in strips, and put into the bride&rsquo;s mouth
partly projecting. The groom must take hold of the projecting part with
his teeth, and eat it. The same performance is gone through with betel
leaf. A doll is now made with cloths, having arms, legs, etc. The
newly-married couple are made to play with it, being much teased the
while by the onlookers, who sing lullabys. The two now have their hands
and feet anointed with turmeric, and are bathed. This is done on three
consecutive days. On the third day is the n&#257;gavalli. The bride and
her husband are escorted under a canopy to some ant heap outside the
village. The man digs a basketful of earth with his knife, which was
given to him, and which he has never relinquished, and the wife carries
it to the house. There the earth is made into four heaps, one near each
post. A hollow is left at the top of each heap, which is filled with
water. During the time they have been fetching the earth, the people
who remained at home have been worshipping air&#275;ni pots
representing Lakshmi, but they now come outside to the pandal. The pair
are escorted all round the village, accompanied with music. They must
not walk, but must be either carried or driven. After their return to
the pandal, they are seated on the n&#257;gavalli simhasanam. Four
small pots are placed in the form of a square, and round these is wound
a fence of thread, which must not be broken in the process. On the pots
are placed bread and meal. The bridal pair again put on their bridal
crowns, and the man, taking his knife, digs a few furrows in the
ground, which his wife fills with grain. The husband then covers up the
grain with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>his knife, after which his wife sprinkles water
over the whole, and then gives her husband some gruel. The bread and
meal, which were placed on the pots, are eaten by the relatives of the
husband publicly in the pandal. After this ceremony is over, the pair
are again anointed, during which process there must be music and
singing. The next day, the whole of the party set off for the
bride&rsquo;s house, where the marala pendli, or second marriage, is
performed. Before setting out, the husband and wife bow down at the
feet of the elders, and receive their blessing. The husband must
provide an abundance of toddy for all. They stay in the house of the
bride&rsquo;s people for three days, and then another feast is made. On
the fourth day, all, except the relations of the bride, return to their
villages, but, before their departure, the bride again pays homage to
the departing elders, who bless her, and give her a small present of
money. On their return, they are met outside the village, and are
escorted to the husband&rsquo;s house with music. The married pair
usually remain in the house of the bride&rsquo;s mother for a month,
and during that time they never change their wedding garments, or take
off the garlands of flowers. The parents of the bridegroom present
their daughter-in-law with new clothes, but these must not have any
indigo in them. If the bride is past puberty, at the end of the month
the father and mother-in-law will return with the married couple to the
husband&rsquo;s village. If the girl has not reached puberty, she will
only spend a short time in her husband&rsquo;s house, and will
afterwards be continually going backwards and forwards between the two
houses. At the time of puberty, the matter is made known to all parties
concerned. The Chalav&#257;dhi must be the bearer of the news, and he
is treated to as much food and drink as he can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>take, and is also given presents. When the
messenger goes, he must carry with him dal, jaggery, sugar-candy, etc.
The neighbours come out to see how much he has brought, and, if the
amount is small, they make a fuss. During the ceremonies which ensue,
the girl is made to sit down, and is blessed by the women sprinkling
her with nalugu, and is also given sweetmeats to eat. The time is made
merry by song and music. After bathing, the girl is made to take food
out of a dish along with three married women. She is then made to touch
a thorn tree three times, and also plucks the leaves. Upon returning to
the house, she is made to touch the cooking instruments and pots. At
this time, if anyone has lent her beads or ornaments, they are taken,
and, after being threaded on new strings, are returned to the lenders.
If the day on which a girl reaches puberty is an unlucky day, it is
considered a bad sign for the husband. On the second occasion the
husband comes for his wife, and there is much rejoicing. After being
detained for four or five days, they go to their permanent home, the
house of the husband&rsquo;s father, and there is at that time much
weeping. The mother tells the girl to be obedient to her husband and
parents-in-law, and says that it will be better for her to throw
herself into a well and die than to return home disgraced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are slight differences in the ceremonies described
above according to the district and sect of the people. In the eastern
Telugu country, during the marriage ceremonies, there is a sort of
bridesmaid, who accompanies the bride on the day of the wedding. In the
western country, largely under the influence of the Canarese, the
bridesmaid is scarcely distinguishable from the real bride, but she is
not, as at home, an unmarried girl, but must be a mature woman
following the functions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href=
"#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>of a married life. There is
another slight difference between the two sections concerning the
Bh&#363;mala ceremony. The Vaishnavites, after the arranged people have
partaken of the feast, distribute the remainder of the food; the
Saivites, on the other hand, if any food is left, bury it somewhere
inside the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&#257;las may be married many times, and indeed it is not
considered respectable to remain a widower. A widower is unable to make
arrangements for the marriage of others, to take part in any of the
ceremonies connected therewith, except in the capacity of a spectator.
It is not the correct thing for a man to have two wives at one time
unless the first one is barren, or unless there is other good cause. A
woman must on no account marry again. She need not, according to Telugu
morals, be ashamed of living, after she is widowed, with another man as
his concubine, but, at the very mention of marriage, she covers her
face with shame. If such people become Christians, it is a most
difficult thing to overcome their prejudice, and persuade them to
become legally man and wife. Almost the only way to do so is by
refusing to marry their children. In the Canarese country, there is a
kind of half marriage (ch&#299;ra kattinchinaru, they have tied her
cloth), which may be attained by widows. It is not reckoned as a proper
marriage, nor is the woman considered a concubine. The ceremony for
this is not performed at the great length of an ordinary marriage, but
it must receive the sanction of the elders. In spite of their sanction,
the man must pay a fine imposed by the caste guru. The woman is
permitted to wear the t&#257;li or marriage token, but not bangles or
other jewels usually worn by a married woman. The children are part
inheritors, and are not entirely without rights, as the children of
concubines are. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368"
name="pb368">368</a>]</span>A man&rsquo;s second wife must wear two
t&#257;lis&mdash;that of the first wife as well as her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following variants of the Pedda T&#257;mb&#363;lam ceremony,
which is performed during the marriage rites, may be noted. As soon as
all are assembled in the front yard of the bride&rsquo;s house, a
blanket is spread on the floor, and covered with a cloth. About ten
seers of cholam (millet: <i>Sorghum</i>) are heaped up, and a brass
vessel (kalasam) is placed thereon. By its side, a lamp is kept
burning. A D&#257;sari, or a M&#257;la priest, stands on one side of
it, and a married woman on the other. The names of the gods are
mentioned, one after the other, and the woman throws two betel leaves
and a nut on the kalasam for each name uttered. The bride is then
brought from within the house, and the leaves and nuts are tied up in a
cloth. This, with the kalasam, is put in the bride&rsquo;s cloth, and
she is led inside. In some places, the ceremony is more elaborate. For
the betrothal ceremony some leading men of the village, and the headmen
of the bride and bridegroom&rsquo;s villages, are required to be
present. The Chalavati (caste servant) hands over a bag containing
betel leaves, areca nuts, pieces of turmeric, and Rs. 4&ndash;6, to the
headman of the bride&rsquo;s village. All these articles are displayed
on a new bamboo sieve, or on the lid of a bamboo box. The two headmen
discuss the proposed match, and exchange betel and nut thrice. After
this, the bride-elect (chinnap&#257;pa) is brought from the house, and
seated on a plank or on a cloth roller (dhone). Three handfuls of betel
leaves and areca nuts are placed in her lap. Her maternal uncle then
puts on her neck a string of unwoven unbleached cotton thread dyed with
turmeric. The bride&rsquo;s headman asks the assembly if he may proceed
with the thonuku ceremony. With their permission, he takes from a sieve
betel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>leaves, nuts, and a cocoanut with his right
hand, using only the thumb, first, and ring fingers. While doing this,
he is expected to stand on one leg, and to take up the various things,
without letting even a single leaf or nut fall. In some places, the
headman has the privilege of doing this seated near the sieve. In other
places, he is said to hold a knife in his hand, with a blade passed
below the middle finger, and over the first ring finger.</p>
<p>In connection with birth ceremonies, Mr. Nicholson writes as
follows. &ldquo;During labour, a sickle and some n&#299;m (<i>Melia
Azadirachta</i>) leaves are always kept upon the cot, to ward off evil
spirits, which will not approach iron. Difficulty during labour is
considered to be the effect of kharma, and the method employed for
easing it is simple. Some mother, who has had an &lsquo;easy
time,&rsquo; is called in, and presents the labouring woman with betel,
etc. Should this not be effective, a line of persons is drawn up from
the well to the house, and water is passed from hand to hand until it
reaches the &lsquo;easy time&rsquo; woman, who gives the water to the
sufferer. This last resort is only sought in extreme cases, but, when
it is appealed to, even the caste people will join in the line and
help. After the placenta has come away, the child is placed on a
winnowing basket, which has been previously filled with grain, and
covered with a cloth. The umbilical cord is cut, and the child is
washed, and branded with a hot needle in all places, over twenty in
all, which are considered vital. When the umbilical cord is cut, some
coin is placed over the navel for luck. This, with the grain in the
basket, is the midwife&rsquo;s perquisite. Should the child present
with the cord round its neck, a cocoanut is immediately offered. If the
child survives, a cock is offered to the gods on the day the mother
takes her first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370"
name="pb370">370</a>]</span>bath. The placenta is put in a pot, in
which are n&#299;m leaves, and the whole is buried in some convenient
place, generally in the backyard. The reason for this is said to be
that, unless the afterbirth was buried, dogs or other animals might
carry it off, and ever after the child would be of a wandering
disposition. The first bath of the mother takes place on the third,
fifth, seventh, or ninth day after delivery. Every house in the
particular quarter sends a potful of hot water. All the pots are placed
near the spot where the afterbirth was buried. The mother then comes
from the house supported by two women, carrying in her hand the sickle
and n&#299;m leaves. After worshipping the four mud gods which have
been placed on the spot, she takes her seat on the cot on which she was
confined, and, after having her body covered with turmeric, and her
head anointed with a mixture of rice, chunam (lime) and turmeric, she
is bathed by the women in attendance. After the bath, both the mother
and child are garlanded with a root strung on strings, and worn round
the neck and wrists. One of these is eaten every day by the mother. The
mother rises and enters the house, but, before doing so, she worships
the four quarters on the threshold. The women who assisted in the
bathing operation go to their homes, and bathe their own children,
afterwards returning to take part in a feast provided by the parents of
the newly-born child. On this day also a name is given to the child. If
all previous children have died, the child is rolled in leaf plates and
rice, after which the nose and ears are pierced. The rice is given to
the dogs, and the child is named Pulligadu (used up leaf plates) or
Pullamma according to sex. Should the parents consider that they have a
sufficiently large family, they name the child Salayya or Salakka
(enough). There are several <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href=
"#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>superstitions about teething. If
the teeth come quickly, people say that the afterbirth has not been
buried deeply enough. Should the top teeth come first, it is supposed
to imply danger to the maternal uncle, who generally gives his daughter
in marriage to his nephew. He is called, and brings with him a
cocoanut, the inner shell of which he crushes on the child&rsquo;s
head. This must be done without looking on the child. In order that
girls may not grow hair on their faces, their lips and chins are rubbed
with the afterbirth. The dried navel is highly prized as a remedy for
sterility.</p>
<p>In connection with death ceremonies, Mr. Nicholson writes as
follows. &ldquo;There is a difference in the ceremonies performed by
the Vishnuvite and Saivite sects. The former allow their people to die
in the house; the latter, fearing pollution, remove the person outside
the door, as soon as it is recognised that death is at hand. The
following description relates chiefly to the Vishnuvites or Namdaris,
but, wherever possible, the difference of ceremony between the two
sects is noticed. As soon as it is recognized that a person is at the
point of death, the wife and children, or near relations, gather round
the rough string cot, and ask what the dying person&rsquo;s last wishes
are. However bad a life may have been led, the dying words are
considered imperatively binding. If at all possible, the son or brother
of the dying person will give a little food and a drink of water; and,
if there is no one to perform this office&mdash;the rite which entitles
the dying to heaven&mdash;great is the grief. &lsquo;May you have no
one to give you water to drink&rsquo; is a most bitter curse. As soon
as life has departed, those who are standing by will close the eyes and
mouth, and stop the nostrils and ears. The two great toes are tied
together, whilst the wife and sons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372"
href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>burn incense at the head of
the corpse. A lamp is lit, and left in the house. Before this, the near
relations have heard that things were serious, and have come to render
assistance. They now bring water for the bathing, and some go to the
bazar for sweetmeats, etc., required in the subsequent ceremonies. Some
of the elders go to call the D&#257;sari, or priest, and, by the time
he arrives, rice will have been prepared, and the blood of a fowl
sprinkled over the place where the death occurred. It should be
mentioned that the head of the dying is always placed to the south.
Yamudu, the god of death and lord of Hades, is god of the south.
Consequently, if the dead arose, if facing south he would go to the
evil place. By lying on the back with the head to the south, they rise
facing north, and so escape an evil fate. When the food is prepared,
the corpse is removed outside, bathed, and wrapped in a new cloth.
Betel nut and leaf are ground and put into the mouth, whilst the priest
puts the n&#257;mam (the mark of Vishnu) upon both the forehead of the
corpse and of the bearers. After the bathing of the corpse, and before
it is wrapped in the new cloth, a small square piece is torn out of the
cloth, and presented to the Nambi of the temple. The corpse being
prepared, the priest and the wife and relations of the deceased, along
with the bearers, eat a small portion of the food which has been got
ready. Immediately upon rising after having eaten, the corpse is
lifted, and placed upon a rough bier, wrapped in a cloth, and the party
proceed to the burying ground. The priest goes first singing a funeral
hymn, and at the end of each verse all the people cry Govinda (one of
the names of Vishnu). Following the priest comes the Chalav&#257;dhi,
carrying his belt and insignia of office. At every other step the bell
is rung by coming in contact with his leg. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>After the Chalav&#257;dhi comes the corpse
carried by men who are, according to Telugu relationship, brothers
(actual brothers, or sons of father&rsquo;s brother or mother&rsquo;s
sister). In the case of a married woman, the bearers must be either
husband or brothers. Following the corpse comes the wife or son,
bearing water and fire. Shortly before reaching the burial-ground, a
halt is made. The son sprinkles a little water on the ground, and the
bier is placed upon the spot with the fire at the head. The face is
then uncovered, and all look upon the dead features for the last time.
The reason given for the halt is that upon one occasion, according to
tradition, the bearers became exhausted, and, when they rested the bier
upon the ground, the corpse arose alive. In carrying a dead body, it is
always carried feet first. The grave, which has been prepared
beforehand, and which is usually not more than three feet deep, is
reached, and the body is placed therein with the head towards the
south. In the case of a male, after being placed in the grave, the
waist-cord and toe-rings are removed, and left in the grave. In the
case of a woman, the glass bracelets, bell-metal toe-rings, and bead
necklace are left, but no jewels of value or the marriage token are
left. After this is over, the body is covered with leaves of the
tang&#275;du tree (<i>Cassia auriculata</i>). As a rule, Vishnuvites,
before covering the body with leaves, take off the cloth in which it is
wrapped, leaving it naked. This is supposed to be emblematic of the
nakedness with which we enter upon life. The corpse is buried face
upwards, and it is considered a means of future happiness to the
deceased if those assembled throw earth into the grave. The nearer the
relationship of those doing so, the greater is the happiness conferred.
Hence it is always desired that a son should be present. After the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>grave has been filled up half way with earth,
three stones are placed, one at the head, one in the middle, and one at
the feet. Only the Vishnuvites do this. Upon the middle of these stones
stands the priest, while the relatives of the deceased wash his feet,
and put upon them the n&#257;mam or sign of Vishnu. Whilst standing
thus, they bargain and haggle as to what fee is to be paid. After this
is over, the grave is completely filled in, and great care is taken
that the corpse is so covered that it may not be disturbed by jackals
and other animals, at any rate before the fifth day. If it should be
disturbed, heaven will not be reached. So the Telugu curse &lsquo;May
the jackals eat your tongue&rsquo; is a curse of damnation. The
Saivites bury their dead in the cloth, face downwards. After the grave
has been filled in, the fire carried by the son is placed at the head
of the grave, and incense is burnt. Then the water carried from the
house is sprinkled over the grave, and the procession departs homeward.
On their way, they stop at some wayside well, and wash away their
defilement, afterwards sitting on the edge of the well to chew betel
and eat sweetmeats. They may also pay a visit to the temple, where they
again sit and gossip, but perform no worship. If the deceased be a
woman leaving a husband, the talk will be about arrangements for the
marriage which will shortly take place. Immediately the body is taken
from the house for burial, the lamp which was first lighted is
extinguished, and another lighted in its place. Then those who stay at
home (the women do not usually attend a funeral) clean sweep the house,
plastering it with cow-dung. After this, they wait outside the house
for the return of the burial party. The blood relations who have
attended the burial come, and, without entering the house, glance at
the newly-lighted lamp, afterwards <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375"
href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>going to their own homes,
where, before entering, and without touching any of the pots, they must
bathe in hot water. Toddy flows freely at the close of a funeral.
Indeed, this is one of the occasions when excess is most common. From
now until the fifth day, when the Divas&#257;lu ceremony takes place,
fire and a lamp are lighted at the grave each evening at sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Divas&#257;lu ceremony, which is observed by all castes
which follow the R&#257;m&#257;nuja matham or S&#257;t&#257;ni cult, is
generally performed at the dead of night, and with as much ceremony as
possible. All the Namdaris in the village are invited, each being
separately called by the Kondigadu, who is a kind of messenger
belonging to the D&#257;sari or M&#257;la priest. In former days, many
of the S&#363;dras used to attend this ceremony, but of late, either
through M&#257;las more openly eating the flesh of cows, or for some
other reason, they rarely attend, and, if they do so, it is with great
secrecy. The Nambi, however, who is a S&#257;t&#257;ni, should attend.
Indeed, it is he who is the performer of the ceremony. The flesh
required for the sacrifice is found by slaughtering a sheep or a goat.
Before killing it, holy water is poured into its mouth, and incense is
burnt before it. When the animal has been dismembered, the head, guts,
and blood are cooked in one pot, the bones in another, the flesh in a
third, whilst in a fourth pot bread is baked. Toddy and arrack (native
spirit) are also placed in readiness. After these preparations, the
Nambi draws upon the floor, on the spot where the death occurred, the
ashtakshari (eight-cornered) mantram, repeating the while magical
words. The mantram is usually drawn with treble lines, one black, one
yellow, and one white. At each corner are placed a cocoanut, betel,
dates, and a lump of molasses, whilst a rupee is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>placed in the middle at one side. The words
repeated are in Tamil, and, roughly translated, are as follows:
&lsquo;This is the mantram of Manar Nambi. This is the holy water of
the sacred feet of ... Nambi. This is the secret of holiness of the 108
sacred places. These are the means for obtaining heaven. They are for
the saving of the sinner. This drawing is the seal of the saints.
Countless sins have I committed; yet by thought on the saints is sin
cleansed.&rsquo; After the completion of the drawing, the officiating
priest puts the holy mark of Vishnu on the foreheads of those who bring
the vessels of cooked food. Then, to the east side of the drawing, he
makes two little piles of millet. He then asks (in Tamil) for the pot
containing the head, and for the toddy. The two bearers bring the pots,
keeping exactly together, and, as they reach the Nambi, each must
exchange places with the other. The priest then inscribes on one pot
the wheel (chakra), and on the other the conch shell, these being the
sacred symbols of Vishnu. Before doing so, he wets the leaves of the
tulasi plant (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i>) in a rice plate, and places them
in a brass vessel containing holy water by his side. Then, with the
conch shell which he carries, he pours some of the holy water into each
pot, afterwards placing the pots upon the heaps of millet. Next, a leaf
plate is placed in the middle of the drawing. Upon it is placed some of
each variety of food cooked, along with milk and gh&#299;. Over all,
another plate is placed as a cover. During this time, so that no one
may see the ceremony, a sheet or blanket is held up before the Nambi as
a screen. He then takes two little sticks with cotton-wool in a notch
at the end, and puts them to steep in castor-oil. Whilst they are
steeping, he takes a cocoanut, and, after breaking it, pours the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>milk into the vessel containing holy water, and
places the two pieces by the side of the heaps of grain upon which are
the two pots. Then, taking up the two sticks, and having made passes
with them over the whole drawing, he lights them and holds them aloft
above the screen, so that the people on the other side may see them.
All then bow down, and worship the two lights. Then the bearers of the
corpse are invested with the n&#257;mam, after which the whole of those
assembled drink of the holy water in the brass vessel. A little holy
water, betel, etc., are now put into the rice plate, which is
afterwards covered with soil upon the top of the grave. The party then
eat the small portion of food which may be left, and, after trimming
the lamp, proceed to their homes. The Nambi who officiates is supposed
to be particularly holy. If he is wicked and unclean, and yet draws and
sits upon the magic diagrams, he will bring loss and sorrow upon his
own head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other ceremony until the night of the twelfth
day. On this day, not only is the floor plastered with cow-dung, but
the whole house is cleaned outside and in. All the inmates of the house
bathe, shave, and put on clean clothes. Then, as on the fifth day, an
animal is killed, and the flesh is cooked exactly as before. In the
north-east or god&rsquo;s corner, the panchakshari (five cornered)
diagram is inscribed, and a handful of rice is put in the middle. As
before, cocoanuts, etc., are placed at the five corners, and before the
drawing are placed five copper images. The D&#257;sari who performs the
ceremony places two leaf plates before these images, and, breaking a
couple of cocoanuts, sacrifices to them. After this, the Nambi,
D&#257;saris, Kondigadu, corpse-bearers, and bearers of the pots, each
drink two measures of toddy, and eat some of the flesh cooked in the
second <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>pot. The party, consisting entirely of males,
now take as much food as will be required for the forthcoming ceremony,
and proceed towards the grave, which has been previous to this
plastered and decorated, and a little shrine erected at the head. On
their arrival, a diagram, called panchakshari is drawn on the grave in
black, yellow, and white. At the five corners are placed cocoanut,
lime, etc. In the middle is placed a leaf plate with food on it, and a
cocoanut is offered, the two halves being placed one on each side of
the plate. A lamp is now lighted, and placed in the little shrine at
the head of the grave, which the Nambi worships. It may be noted that
the ashtakshari diagram is the sign of Vishnu or Narayanamurti, and the
panchakshari is the sign of Siva. The reason for both being used is
that Vishnu is the preserver, and Siva the destroyer. If Siva alone is
worshipped, he will only cease from destroying; if Vishnu alone is
worshipped, he cannot keep from destruction. Hence there is a sort of
compromise, so that the benefits rendered by each god may be reaped.
The Nambi now invests all the males present with the n&#257;mam, and,
if there is a widow, she is made to put on the bottu or small circular
mark, the symbol most often being associated with Siva. The widow is
made to sit in the middle of the house, with a leaf plate set before
her. There she is stripped of all the jewels she wore as a married
woman. Afterwards she is taken inside by some widows, and, after
bathing, dons a cloth which has been brought for her by her brothers.
Her own cloth is left outside, and must be sent from there to the
washerman. It afterwards becomes a perquisite of the D&#257;sari. If
the deceased was a married woman, the widower would be deprived of his
toe-ring, bathed, and clothed in a new cloth. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;On the occasion of Divas&#257;lu, blood relatives are all
supposed to be present, and the ceremony is an expensive one, poor
people often spending on this occasion alone as much as they can earn
in a couple of months. The first ceremony is not so expensive, and will
only cost about five rupees. All the male relatives of the dead man, or
the brothers-in-law of a dead woman, must bring a little rice and some
sticks of incense. If they are quite unable to attend the ceremony,
they will clean their own houses, and will then perform some ceremony
to the deceased. The relatives of the wife who come to the ceremony
will not proceed to the house, or even to the caste quarters, but will
go to the toddy shop, whence they send word of their arrival. As soon
as the head of the house hears of this, he also proceeds to the toddy
shop, and each one treats the other to drink. If they do not wish to
drink, the one will pour a little liquor into the palm of the other.
This ceremony is called ch&#275;dup&#257;puta (the taking away of
bitterness), and without it they cannot visit one another&rsquo;s
houses. These relatives must only partake of food on the night of their
arrival and next day, but on no account must they linger till the light
is lit on the thirteenth day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The above ceremony is that performed by the Namdaris or
Vishnuvites, who are not afraid of pollution, but who must do all
things according to a prescribed ritual. We will now consider the
ceremonies of the Mondis or Saivites, who think little of ceremony, but
much of defilement. These take the dying person outside, and, as soon
as it is realised that the end is near, all arrangements are made as to
who is to cook, carry the corpse, etc. Before the breath has left the
body, some go to the bazaar to purchase a new cloth. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>women smear themselves with turmeric as at a
wedding, and put a circular red mark (bottu) on the forehead, whilst
the men smear ashes on their foreheads. As soon as the food is cooked,
the dead body is washed, and placed upon a bier. Most of the
Vishnuvites do not use a bier. The corpse is carried to the grave,
accompanied with fire and water as in the Vishnuvite ceremony. Shortly
before the grave-yard is reached, a halt is made. The cloth which has
been placed over the face is torn, and a cooking pot is broken, after
which the body is taken to the grave, and buried without covering,
lying prone on the face. After the earth has been filled in, the son of
the deceased takes an earthen water-pot full of water, and bores a hole
in it, so that the water may escape. He then makes three circuits of
the grave, allowing the water to flow on the ground. After each
circuit, he makes a fresh hole in the pot. He then goes away without
looking back on the grave. When the funeral party, which consists only
of men, reaches the house, they find that some of the old women have
made a heap of cow-dung, at the top of which is a little hollow filled
with water. Those who have returned from the grave dip their great toes
in this water, and then linger on the threshold to worship the lamp
which is inside. After this, the lamp is taken, and thrown outside the
village, and, on their return, they bathe in hot water. The Saivites
perform the first ceremony for the dead on the third day, and they have
neither Nambi nor priest, but perform the whole ceremony themselves.
Like the Vishnuvites, they thoroughly cleanse and plaster the house.
There is no animal sacrifice, but food is prepared with vegetables. A
tray is plaited from the twigs of the tamarind tree (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Tamarindus indica</i>), and in this is placed a leaf plate
containing food, frankincense, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381"
href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>betel, etc. This food
offering is carried to the grave along with fire and water at about
eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The man who carries the food must
wear only a torn cloth, and yet with this he must manage to cover his
head. On reaching the grave, they worship. The tray is left at the head
of the grave, and the people retire a short distance, and there wait
until a crow or a kite comes, and takes food from the tray. The more
quickly this occurs, the greater the merit obtained by the deceased.
They never go away until either the one or the other of these birds
comes. They afterwards proceed to the well, and bathe fully. On the
twelfth day, another ceremony is performed. In the morning, all those
taking part in the ceremony proceed to some place outside the village
where they shave, and put on clean clothes which have come direct to
that place from the washerman. They then go to some temple, and there
obtain a little holy water, with which they afterwards sprinkle
themselves, the widow, and the house of the deceased. The widow is then
arrayed in all her clothes and jewels, and is taken weeping to the
&lsquo;widow&rsquo;s harbour.&rsquo; There a stone image is set up, and
worshipped. Then the woman&rsquo;s jewels are taken off, and her
bracelets broken. Sweet food is cooked and partaken of, all bathe, and
return to their homes. After this ceremony, poor people will stay in
their houses for three days, and rich people for a much longer period.
For several years, on the anniversary of the death, some little
ceremony is usually performed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with M&#257;la D&#257;saris, to whom reference has
already been made, Mr. Nicholson writes as follows. &ldquo;There is a
considerable number of individuals who obtained their living through
religious mendicancy. They are known as D&#257;saris. There is usually
a Nambi <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>or D&#257;sari for every three or four villages.
Some few D&#257;saris have in&#257;m (rent-free) lands, but the
majority live on the charity of the people. They do not ask alms, but
sing hymns in honour of Chennudu or Pedda Muni. They also officiate as
a sort of priest, and their services are requisitioned at the time of
death, marriage, hair-cutting, and the creation of Basavis and
D&#257;saris. The D&#257;sari who officiates at a wedding ceremony
cannot act in a case of death. There is, in the west Telugu country, a
class called V&#257;rapu D&#257;sari, who act as puj&#257;ris for the
S&#363;dras, and in all places the D&#257;sari receives certain
emoluments from S&#363;dras for singing at weddings and funerals. They
receive alms from all classes. Occasionally disturbances take place on
account of the Saivites objecting to the D&#257;saris coming into their
streets, and it is at such times as these that pav&#257;damu is said to
take place. It is firmly believed that, if a D&#257;sari is offended,
he will revenge himself in smaller offences by piercing his cheeks or
side, for a serious offence by killing himself, generally by severing
the head from the body. If one kills himself in this way, the news is
said to be immediately and miraculously communicated to every
D&#257;sari and Nambi in the country. They all come to the place where
the body lies. Until their arrival, this has been kept covered with a
new cloth, and water is constantly sprinkled over it, to keep the
wounds from drying up. When the Gurus, D&#257;saris, and others are
collected, they show their magic power by frying fish, which come to
life again on being placed in water, and by cutting limes in two and
making them join together, while the remainder sing hymns to Chennudu,
and call on the name of Govinda. The Gurus then dig a hole, and in it
light the sacred fire of sandal-wood, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>which must be kindled
by the friction of two pieces of wood. All assemble before this sacred
fire, and join in singing or reciting the Dandakamu, after which the
D&#257;saris dance a dance called the request dance. A lotus flower is
simulated by arranging betel leaves in a small chembu (metal vessel),
and this is placed in a plate along with the severed head. The tray is
then carried three times round the corpse by the wife of the deceased
if he was married; if not, by his mother; and, if he had no kin, by a
Basavi. The head is then taken by the Guru, and fixed properly to the
trunk, the junction being plentifully daubed with sacred earth
(tirumani). A new cloth is then spread over the corpse, and a network
of flowers over all. The D&#257;saris again walk round the corpse,
calling on Tembaru Manara, repeating at the same time a mantram. Then
Kurumayya, the caste Guru, strokes the corpse from head to foot three
times with his staff, after which he places his foot on the head of the
corpse, and calls on the body to rise. The ability of the D&#257;saris
to perform this marvel is implicitly believed in. Some I have asked
have seen it attempted, but on one occasion it failed because the wife
was unwell (under menstrual pollution). On another occasion, the
ceremony was not carried out with fitting reverence, and failed in
consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief people among the D&#257;saris are Guru, Annalayya,
Godugulayya (umbrella men), and Tuttulayya (horn-blowers). The
D&#257;saris have got certain badges of office, which are supposed to
have been given by Chennudu on the conquest of Vijayanagar. [According
to tradition, between the 8th and 11th centuries A.D. there was great
rivalry between the Saivite and Vishnuvite sects, and it is supposed
that Kurumayya, fighting on the side of the Vishnuvites, by the aid of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>god Chennudu was able to suppress and overcome
the followers of Siva. He thus became the Guru of the M&#257;las.] The
D&#257;sari&rsquo;s insignia consist of an iron staff, copper pot,
tiger skin, antelope skin, etc. Besides these, some of the chief
D&#257;saris are said to possess copper inscriptions given to them by
the kings of Vijayanagar, but these they refuse to allow any one to
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the practice of making Basavis (dedicated prostitutes),
Mr. Nicholson writes as follows. &ldquo;The origin of the Basavis is
said to be thus. In former times, the As&#257;dhis had the duty and
privilege of dancing and singing before the God, but this office was
always performed by a male. On one occasion, there was no male to take
up the duties, and, as there was no prospect of further children, one
of the daughters was appointed to the work, so that the livelihood
would not be lost. Then no one came forward to marry the girl, and she
found it impossible to live a good life. The fact, however, that she
was a servant of the God kept her from disgrace, and from that time it
has been customary to dedicate these girls to the God&rsquo;s service.
Nowadays, the girl goes through a ceremony with a knife, which is
placed in front of the God, and, as at ordinary weddings, there are all
the various ceremonies performed, and feasts eaten. If at the time of
the wedding, any man wishes to have a sort of proprietary right, he may
obtain the same by paying a sort of dowry. The elders of the village
must give their consent to the dedication, and usually signify this by
eating out of the same plate as the bride. In the west Telugu country,
parents who have good looking daughters, no matter what their class,
give them as Basavis. But, in the east Telugu country, only the
As&#257;dhi, Bein&#275;ni, and Pambala people do so. A Basavi can never
be widowed, and people say they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385"
href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>are consecrated to the God.
Consequently, their life, though a life of sin, is not considered so by
the Gods. Yet by a strange inconsistency, men consorting with Basavis
are immediately branded as loose men. The first few years of a
Basavi&rsquo;s life are full of profit, and it is probably for this
reason that parents are willing thus to sacrifice their daughters.
Afterwards, when the charms of youth are passed, the Basavi resorts to
begging, or, with two or three more, obtains a precarious livelihood by
music and dancing. Their children have a share in the maternal
father&rsquo;s property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The above account of a Basavi&rsquo;s dedication applies to
the As&#257;dhis or singing beggars. The following is a more detailed
description of the ceremony as performed by the D&#257;saris. The girl
to be dedicated is dressed in a white ravike and cloth, after which she
is conducted to the priest who is to officiate. He burns the signs of a
chank and chakram on the girl&rsquo;s shoulders, presenting to her at
the same time holy water. After this, the priest receives the guruvu
kanika, which consists not only of five rupees, but also five seers of
rice, five cocoanuts, five garlics, and a quarter of a seer of betel
nuts. The person giving the girl away now receives permission from the
people and Guruvu, and attaches the marriage symbol to the girl&rsquo;s
neck. Before the t&#257;li is tied, the girl is made to sit on a
blanket, upon which has been drawn the &lsquo;throne,&rsquo; with her
hands which clasp the Garuda stambha tied together with a wreath of
flowers. Before the hands are unbound, in place of the usual dowry of
about twenty rupees, five duddu (copper coins) are given into the hand
of the priest. All assembled now worship the beggar&rsquo;s staff, and,
on proceeding to the place of lodging, food is given to the
D&#257;saris. Usually the ceremonies are performed before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>the
village shrine, but, at times of festival, they are performed before
the God, in honour of whom the festival is being held. On returning to
the village, the girl is obliged, for five consecutive Saturdays, to go
round the village accompanied by a D&#257;sari, to whose food and
comfort she has to attend. This is, no doubt, a public announcement of
the profession the girl has had put upon her. When puberty is arrived
at, a feast is given, and thenceforward the girl is her own
mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The M&#257;las worship a variety of deities, including Gurappa,
Subbarayadu, Gunnathadu, Sunkalamma, Poleramma, Gangamma, and
Gontiy&#257;lamma. In connection with the worship of the goddess
Gontiy&#257;lamma, Mr. F. R. Hemingway writes, in a note on the
M&#257;las of the God&#257;vari district, that &ldquo;the special caste
deity is Gontiy&#257;lamma, the mother of the five Pandava brethren.
They say that Bh&#299;ma threatened to kill his mother, who took refuge
under an avir&#275;ni pot (painted pot used at weddings) in a
M&#257;la&rsquo;s house. For this she was solemnly cursed by her sons,
who said that she should remain a M&#257;la woman for ever. In
commemoration of this story, a handful of growing paddy (rice) is
pulled up every year at the Dasara festival, and, eight days later, the
earth adhering to its roots is mixed with turmeric and milk, made into
an image of the goddess, and hidden under the avir&#275;ni pot. For the
next six months this image is worshipped every Sunday by all the
villagers in turn, and, on the Sivar&#257;tri night, it is taken round
the village, accompanied by all the M&#257;las bearing pots of rice and
other food carried in a k&#257;vadi, and is finally thrown with much
ceremony into a river or tank (pond or lake). This rite is supposed to
mean that the goddess is the daughter of the caste, that she has lived
with them six months, and that they are now sending her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>back
with suitable gifts (the rice, etc.) to her husband. A common form of
religious vow among M&#257;las is to promise to send a cloth and a cow
with the goddess on the last day of the rite, the gifts being
afterwards presented to a married daughter.&rdquo; It is noted by Mr.
Hemingway that both M&#257;las and M&#257;digas hold a feast in honour
of their ancestors at Pongal&mdash;an uncommon rite.</p>
<p>In the God&#257;vari district scarcity of rain is dealt with in
various ways. &ldquo;It is considered very efficacious if the
Br&#257;hmans take in procession round the village an image of Varuna
(the god of rain) made of mud from the tank of a river or tank. Another
method is to pour 1,000 pots of water over the lingam in the Siva
temple. M&#257;las tie a live frog to a mortar, and put on the top of
the latter a mud figure representing Gontiy&#257;lamma. They then take
these objects in procession, singing &lsquo;Mother frog, playing in
water, pour rain by pots full.&rsquo; The villagers of other castes
then come and pour water over the M&#257;las.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5334src" href="#xd21e5334" name="xd21e5334src">31</a> Mr.
Nicholson writes that, to produce rain in the Telugu country,
&ldquo;two boys capture a frog, and put it into a basket with some
n&#299;m (<i lang="la-x-bio">Melia Azadirachta</i>) leaves. They tie
the basket to the middle of a stick, which they support on their
shoulders. In this manner they make a circuit of the village, visiting
every house, singing the praises of the god of rain. The greater the
noise the captive animal makes, the better the omen, and the more gain
for the boys, for, at every house, they receive something in
recognition of their endeavour to bring rain upon the village
fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Mala Arayan.</b>&mdash;The Mala Arayans are described, in the
Travancore Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a class of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>hill
tribes, who are a little more civilized than the Mann&#257;ns, and have
fixed abodes on the slopes of high mountain ranges. Their villages are
fine-looking, with trees and palms all round. They are superior in
appearance to most other hill tribes, but are generally short in
stature. Some of the Arayans are rich, and own large plots of
cultivated grounds. They seldom work for hire, or carry loads. A
curious custom with them is that every man in the family has his own
room separate from the rest, which only he and his wife are permitted
to enter. They are very good hunters and have a partiality for monkey
flesh. As wizards they stand very high, and all the low-country people
cherish a peculiar dread for them. Makkath&#257;yam is the prevailing
form of inheritance (from father to son), but among a few families
marumakkath&#257;yam (inheritance through the female line) obtains as
an exception. Their language is a corrupt form of Malay&#257;lam. Their
marriage ceremony is simple. The bridegroom and bride sit and eat on
the same plantain leaf, after which the t&#257;li (marriage badge) is
tied. The bride then seizes any ornament or cooking vessel in the
house, saying that it is her father&rsquo;s. The bridegroom snatches it
from her, and the marriage rite is concluded. Birth pollution is of
considerable importance. It lasts for a whole month for the father, and
for seven days for the mother. The Arayans bury their dead. Drinking is
a very common failing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded by Mr. M. J. Walhouse<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5348src" href="#xd21e5348" name="xd21e5348src">32</a> that
&ldquo;on the higher ranges in Travancore there are three of
Parasur&#257;ma&rsquo;s cairns, where the Mala Arraiyans still keep
lamps burning. They make miniature cromlechs of small slabs of stone,
and place within them a long pebble to represent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>the
deceased. Dr. Livingstone noticed a similar custom in Africa. &lsquo;In
various villages we observed miniature huts about two feet high, very
neatly thatched and plastered. Here we noticed them in dozens. On
inquiry we were told that, when a child or relative dies, one is made,
and, when any pleasant food is cooked or beer brewed, a little is
placed in the tiny hut for the departed soul, which is believed to
enjoy it.&rsquo; So the Mala Arraiyans offer arak (liquor) and
sweetmeats to the departed spirit <span class="corr" id="xd21e5353"
title="Not in source">believed</span> to be hovering near the miniature
cromlech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a detailed account of the Mala Arayans, the Rev. S. Mateer writes
as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5359src" href="#xd21e5359" name=
"xd21e5359src">33</a> &ldquo;The Arayans bury their dead; consequently
there are many ancient tumuli in these hills, evidently graves of
chiefs, showing just the same fragments of pottery, brass figures, iron
weapons, etc., as are found in other similar places. These tumuli are
often surrounded with long splintered pieces of granite, from eight to
twelve or fifteen feet in length, set up on end, with sacrificial
altars and other remains, evidently centuries old. Numerous vaults,
too, called P&#257;ndi Kuri, are seen in all their hills. They stand
north and south, the circular opening being to the south; a round stone
is fitted to this aperture, with another acting as a long lever, to
prevent its falling out; the sides, as also the stones of the top and
bottom, are single slabs. To this day the Arayans make similar little
cells of pieces of stone, the whole forming a box a few inches square;
and, on the death of a member of any family, the spirit is supposed to
pass, as the body is being buried, into a brass or silver image, which
is shut into this vault; if the parties are very poor, an oblong
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>smooth stone suffices. A few offerings of milk,
rice, toddy, and ghee (clarified butter) are made, a torch is lighted
and extinguished, the figure placed inside the cell, and the covering
hastily put on; then all leave. On the anniversary, similar offerings
being made, the stone is lifted off, and again hastily closed. The
spirit is thus supposed to be enclosed; no one ventures to touch the
cell at any other time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The objects of Arayan worship are the spirits of their
ancestors, or certain local demons supposed to reside in rocks or
peaks, and having influence only over particular villages or families.
The religious services rendered to these are intended to deprecate
anger rather than to seek benefits; but in no case is lust to be
gratified, or wickedness practiced, as pleasing to these deities. One
of their ancestors is represented by a brass image about three inches
in height, the back of the head hollow, the hands holding a club and a
gun. This represents a demonized man of wicked character, who lived
about a century ago. He is said to have beaten his wife to death with a
club; wherefore the people joined to break his skull, and he became a
malignant demon. Another image carried an umbrella and staff, and had a
milder countenance&mdash;this was a good demon. One such image is kept
in each family, in which the spirit is supposed actually to reside.
They were also put into the little square chambers described above. The
Rev. W. J. Richards, of Cottayam, has favoured me with the following
history, which throws much light upon this curious superstition.
&lsquo;T&#257;lan&#257;ni was a priest or oracle-revealer of the
hunting deity, Ayappan, whose chief shrine is in Savarimala, a hill
among the Travancore gh&#257;ts. The duty of T&#257;lan&#257;ni was to
deck himself out in his sword, bangles, beads, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>etc., and, highly frenzied with excitement and
strong drink, dance in a horrid convulsive fashion before his idols,
and reveal in unearthly shrieks what the god had decreed on any
particular matter. He belonged to the Hill Arayan village of
Eruma-p&#257;ra (the rock of the she-buffalo), some eight miles from
M&#275;lk&#257;vu, and was most devoted to his idolatry, and rather
remarkable in his peculiar way of showing his zeal. When the pilgrims
from his village used to go to Savarimala&mdash;a pilgrimage which is
always, for fear of the tigers and other wild beasts, performed in
companies of forty or fifty&mdash;our hero would give out that he was
not going, and yet, when they reached the shrine of their devotions,
there before them was the sorcerer, so that he was both famous among
his fellows and favoured of the gods. Now, while things were in this
way, T&#257;lan&#257;ni was killed by the neighbouring Ch&#333;gans
during one of his drunken bouts, and the murderers, burying his body in
the depths of the jungle, thought that their crime would never be found
out; but the tigers&mdash;Ayappan&rsquo;s dogs&mdash;in respect to so
true a friend of their master, scratched open the grave, and removing
the corpse, laid it on the ground. The wild elephants found the body,
and reverently took it where friends might discover it, and, a plague
of small-pox having attacked the Ch&#333;gans, another oracle declared
it was sent by S&#257;st&#257;vu (the Travancore hill boundary god,
called also Ch&#257;ttan or S&#257;ttan) in anger at the crime that had
been committed; and that the evil would not abate until the murderers
made an image of the dead priest, and worshipped it. This they did,
placing it in a grave, and in a little temple no bigger than a small
dog kennel. The image itself is about four inches high, of bronze. The
heir of T&#257;lan&#257;ni became priest and beneficiary of the new
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>shrine, which was rich in offerings of arrack,
parched rice, and meat vowed by the Arayans when they sallied out on
hunting expeditions. All the descendants of T&#257;lan&#257;ni are
Christians, the result of the Rev. Henry Baker&rsquo;s work. The last
heir who was in possession of the idol, sword, bangle, beads, and wand
of the sorcerer, handed them over to the Rev. W. J. Richards in
1881.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lamps to the memory of their ancestors were kept burning in
little huts, and at stones used to represent the spirits of their
ancestors. At one spot, where the genii were supposed to reside, there
was a fragment of granite well oiled, and surrounded by a great number
of extinguished torches. A most fearful demon was said to reside in a
hollow tree, which had been worshipped by thousands of families. They
did not know the precise hole in which the symbol was to be found; when
discovered, it looked like the hilt of an old sword. One deity was said
by the priest of a certain hill to have placed three curious looking
rocks as resting-places for himself on his journey to the peak.
Cocoanuts are offered to famous demons, residing in certain hills. It
has been observed that, in cases of sickness, sometimes Arayans will
make offerings to a Hindu god, and that they attend the great feasts
occasionally; but in no case do they believe that they are under any
obligation to do so, their own spirits being considered fully equal to
the Hindu gods. Each village has its priest, who, when required, calls
on the &lsquo;hill&rsquo; (mala), which means the demon resident there,
or the pr&#275;tham, ghost. If he gets the afflatus, he acts in the
usual way, yelling and screaming out the answers sought. The
devil-dancer wears the kudumi, and has a belt, bangles, and other
implements; and invokes the demons in case of sickness. <span class=

<p>&ldquo;They have some sacred groves, where they will not fire a gun,
or speak above a breath; they have certain signs also to be observed
when fixing on land for cultivation or the site of a house, but no
other elaborate religious rites. In <span class="corr" id="xd21e5375"

plains, must bathe before returning. They consider themselves polluted
by all castes below N&#257;yars. The name M&#363;ttan is properly a
title, meaning elder, confirmed on their headman by their janmis
(landlords). Their chief god is Malad&#275;van. They are good forest

<p><b>Malasar.</b>&mdash;The Malasars or Malsars are found in the
Coimbatore district, and in the Cochin State. The following account of
them was given by Buchanan a century ago.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5421src" href="#xd21e5421" name="xd21e5421src">34</a> &ldquo;The
forests here are divided into Puddies, each of which has its boundary
ascertained, and contains one or more families of a rude tribe, called
Malasir. Both the Puddy and its inhabitants are considered as the
property of some landlord, who farms out the labour of these poor
people, with all they collect, to some trader (Chitty or Manadi).
Having sent for some of these poor Malasirs, they informed me that they
live in small villages of five or six huts, situated in the skirts of
the woods on the hills of Daraporam, Ani-malaya, and Pali-ghat. They
speak a mixture of the Tamul and Malayala languages. They are a better
looking people than the slaves, but are ill-clothed, nasty, and
apparently ill-fed. They collect drugs for the trader, to whom they are
let, and receive from him a subsistence, when they can procure for him
anything of value. He has the exclusive right of purchasing all that
they have for sale, and of supplying them with salt and other
necessaries. A great part of their food consists of wild yams
(<i>Dioscorea</i>), which they dig when they have nothing to give to
the trader for rice. They cultivate some small spots in the woods after
the cotu-cadu fashion, both on their own account and on that of the
neighbouring farmers, who receive the produce, and give the Malasirs
hire. The articles cultivated in this manner are ragi (<i>Eleusine
Coracana</i>), avaray (<i>Dolichos Lablab</i>), and tonda (<i>Ricinus
communis</i>). They are also hired to cut timber and firewood. The god
of their tribe is called Mallung, who is represented <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>by a
stone that is encircled by a wall, which serves for a temple. Once a
year, in April, a sacrifice of goats, and offerings of rice, honey, and
the like, are made by the Malasir to this rude idol. If this be
neglected, the god sends elephants and tigers to destroy both them and
their houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Malasars are described, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as
&ldquo;a forest tribe living by hill cultivation and day labour. They
are good at game-tracking, and very handy with their axes, with the
help of which they will construct a bamboo house for the wandering
sportsman in a few hours. They reside in hamlets known as pathis, each
of which has a headman, called Vendari, who exercises the usual
authority, with the assistance of a panch&#257;yat (council). One of
the punishments inflicted by panch&#257;yats is to make the culprit
carry a heavy load of sand for some distance, and then stand with it on
his head and beg for forgiveness. They worship K&#257;li and
M&#257;riamman, the small-pox goddess, but their special deity is
Manakad&#257;tta, to whom they sacrifice fowls and sheep in the
M&#257;si. A man of the tribe acts as priest on these occasions, and
keeps the heads of the offerings as his perquisite. An unusual item in
their wedding ceremonies is the tying of an iron ring to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s wrist. They will eat and drink almost anything,
except vermin and cobras. The K&#257;dans regard themselves as superior
to the Malasars.&rdquo; It is noted, in the Manual of the Coimbatore
district, that &ldquo;the Malasars live at a much lower elevation than
the K&#257;dars. They are found almost down on the plains, and along
the slopes near the foot of the hills. They are somewhat sturdier in
general build, but have not the characteristic features of regular
hillmen. They are not to be depended on in any way, but will desert
<i>en masse</i> on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396"
name="pb396">396</a>]</span>the smallest excuse. They commit dacoities
whenever they see an opportunity, and, in fact, even to this day, the
roads near the foot of the hills are rarely traversed by low-country
natives except in small bands, from fear of the Malasars. On the other
hand, the Malasars are useful as being excellent axemen; and as baggage
coolies they can hardly be dispensed with. They carry for the most part
on their heads like low-country coolies, but unlike the K&#257;dars and
Puliyars, who, when they can be induced to carry at all, carry loads on
their backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There may be said to be three grades of Malasars, viz., the Malai
(hill) Malasars, who live on the hills (<i>e.g.</i>, at Mount Stuart on
&#256;naimalais), and the Malasars who live on the slopes and the
plains. It is said that K&#257;dirs and Eravalars are admitted into the
Malasar caste. The K&#257;dirs abstain from eating the flesh of the
&lsquo;bison&rsquo; and cow, whereas the Malasars will eat the carrion
of these animals. The settlements of the Malasars are called padhis or
pathis, and their streets s&#257;lais. These are Tamil names, denoting
villages and rows. The padhis are named after the owners of the land on
which they are built, <i>e.g.</i>, Sircar (Government) padhi, Karuppa
Goundan padhi. On the hills, the dwelling huts are made of bamboo
matting thatched with grass and teak leaves, whereas on the plains the
walls are made of mud, and are roofed with grass and bamboo. Like the
Y&#257;n&#257;dis and Chenchus, the Malasars seem to have an objection
to well-built houses, and a Malasar forester prefers his own rude hut
to Government quarters.</p>
<p>Some Malasars work as coolies, while others are employed as
agricultural labourers, or in collecting honey. A landlord keeps under
him a number of Malasars, to whom he gives land free of rent, on which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>they raise their food-crops. In return, they are
expected to work in the fields, and do other services for their
landlord (Mann&#257;di), who exercises absolute control over them.
Sometimes, if a landholder has a grievance against another, it is not
difficult to induce his Malasars to damage the crops of his enemy. The
operations connected with the catching and taming of wild elephants are
carried out by Malasars. They are proverbially lazy, and will take a
week&rsquo;s wages in advance, and spend a good portion thereof on
drink on the same day. With the remainder provisions are purchased, and
they may only put in three or four days&rsquo; work in the week. Like
other hill tribes, they dig up yams when food is scarce.</p>
<p>Marriage is generally adult, though infant marriage is not
prohibited. The Malasars of the plains perform the marriage ceremonies
at the home of the bride. Monday is considered an auspicious day for
their celebration. On the previous day, the contracting couple stand on
a pestle, and are anointed, and bathe. Two balls of cooked rice,
coloured red and black, are placed in a tray, and lighted wicks are
stuck into them. The flames from the two wicks should be of the same
height, or the omens would be considered unfavourable. The lights are
waved in front of the bride and bridegroom, to ward off the evil eye.
After bathing, the couple are seated on a dais within the marriage
pandal (booth), and the bridegroom ties the t&#257;li (marriage badge)
on the neck of the bride, and their hands are joined by the M&#363;ppan
(headman). The t&#257;li consists of a brass disc, tied to a string
dyed with turmeric. The couple eat from the same leaf or plate, and the
ceremony is at an end.</p>
<p>The Malai Malasars bring the bride to the home of the bridegroom for
the marriage ceremonies. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href=
"#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>bridegroom goes on a Wednesday to
the bride&rsquo;s house and takes her to his home on the following day.
A pandal, made of <i>Sorghum</i> and bamboo stems, is erected. Towards
evening, the t&#257;li is tied, and the fingers of the contracting
couple are linked together (kaidharam). They eat together from the same
plate. The bridegroom should feed his relations and friends at his own
house, as well as at that of the bride. He generally presents his
mother-in-law with a female cloth, with an eight anna bit tied in the
skirt thereof.</p>
<p>Ancestor worship is important among the Malayans. Before commencing
their ceremonies, cooked rice and the flesh of the fowl are offered to
the ancestors on seven leaves. On the occasion of a marriage, a little
of the food is eaten by the bridegroom on a Wednesday, before he
proceeds to the home of the bride.</p>
<p>When a girl reaches maturity, she occupies a separate hut for seven
days. On the seventh day, she bathes and goes to the dwelling hut. A
measure and a lamp are placed before the hut, and the girl has to go
over them with her right foot foremost. She then steps backwards, and
again goes over them before entering the hut.</p>
<p>The dead are usually buried, face upward. If the dead person was an
elder, his personal effects, such as pillows, walking-stick, and
clothes, are buried with him, or his corpse is cremated. Sometimes, the
dead are buried in a sitting posture, in a niche excavated on one side
of the grave. In the case of the Malasars of the plains, the widow
chews betel leaf and areca nuts, and spits the betel over the eyes and
neck of the corpse. On the third day after death, cooked rice and meat
are offered to the soul of the deceased on seven arka (<i>Calotropis
gigantea</i>) leaves. The male members of the family then eat from the
same leaf. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Malasars who live in the plains consider the <i>Ficus
glomerata</i> tree sacred, and worship it once a year. At least one
branch thereof should be used in the construction of the marriage
pandal, and the menstrual hut should be made of it. The Malasars of the
plains also avoid the use of the <i>Pongamia glabra</i> tree for any
purpose. The hill Malasars worship, among other deities,
Ponn&#257;lamman (M&#257;riamma), Pullarappachi (Gan&#275;sa), and
K&#257;liamman. To Ponn&#257;lamman, pigs and buffaloes are sacrificed
once a year. The deity worshipped by the Malasars of the plains is
M&#257;ri&#257;yi (M&#257;riamma), at whose festival a stake is fixed
in the ground, and eventually shaken by the Malasars, and removed by
Paraiyans. The Malasar women of the plains wear glass bangles only on
the left wrist. If a woman puts such bangles on both wrists, the
Paraiyans are said to break them, and report the matter to the
M&#363;ppan, who is expected to fine the woman. As Paraiyan women, like
the Malasars, only wear glass bangles on one wrist, they take the
wearing of bangles on both wrists by Malasar women, who are only their
equals, as an insult.</p>
<p>The following graphic account of a K&#257;ma Mystery Play, in which
Malasars are represented, has been given by Mr. S. G. Roberts.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5487src" href="#xd21e5487" name=
"xd21e5487src">35</a> &ldquo;The play, as the writer saw it in a little
village on the banks of the Amravati river, was at once a mystery or
miracle play, a mime, a tragedy that strangely recalled the Greek
choral tragedies, and a satyric drama. These various ingredients gave
it a quaint nebulous character, the play now crystallising into mere
drama, and again dissolving into a religious rite. Just as an
understanding of the Greek mythology is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>necessary for the
full grasping of the meaning of a Greek tragedy, so it is necessary to
portray the legend which is the basis of this mystery, all the more as
the characters are Hindu gods. K&#257;ma, then, is the Hindu Cupid, not
a tiny little child like the Roman god of love, but more like Eros. He
has beautiful attributes. His bow is of the sugar-cane; his arrows are
tipped with flowers; and his bow-string is a chain of bees&mdash;a
pretty touch that recalls the swallow song of the Homeric bowstring.
For all that, the genius of the country has modified the local idea of
Eros. He has long ago found his Psyche: in point of fact, this Hindu
Eros is a married man. His wife, Rathi, is the other speaking
character, and she certainly displays a beautiful eloquence not
unfitting her position. Moreover, like every married man, K&#257;ma has
a father-in-law, and here the tragedy begins to loom out of the playful
surroundings of a god of love of whatever nation or clime. Siva, the
destroyer, he of the bright blue neck, the dweller, as K&#257;ma
tauntingly says, among graves and dead men&rsquo;s ashes; Siva, mighty
in penance, is father of Rathi. In the play itself, he is not even a
<i>muta persona</i>; he does not appear at all. What he does is only
adumbrated by the action or song of the other characters. The legend
strikingly illustrates the Hindu view of penance. Briefly stated, it is
that anyone who performs any penance for a sufficiently long time
acquires such a store of power and virtue, that the very gods
themselves cannot stand against it. Hindu mythology affords many
examples of this belief. Siva himself, in one of his incarnations,
saved the whole Indian Olympus and the universe at large from a
demi-god, who, by years of penance, had become charged, as it were,
with power, like a religious electric &lsquo;accumulator.&rsquo; The
early sages and heroes of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href=
"#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span>Indian story had greater
facilities for the acquisition of this reserve of power, in that their
lives lasted for centuries or even &aelig;ons. It may be imagined that
three centuries of penance increased the performer&rsquo;s strength to
a degree not expressible in modern figures! In this case, the gods had
viewed with alarm a penance which Siva had begun, and which threatened
to make him master of all creation. In spite of a few grotesque
attributes, the mythology lends to Siva a character at once terrific
and awe-inspiring. When his third eye was closed on one occasion, the
universe was involved in darkness, and the legend under discussion
presents a solemn picture of the god, sitting with his rosary in
sackcloth and ashes, immersed in his unending penance. K&#257;ma was
deputed to break the spell. Accompanied by his nymphs, he sported
before the recluse, taking all shapes that could &lsquo;shake the
saintship of an anchorite,&rsquo; till this oriental St. Anthony, but
too thoroughly aroused, opened his tremendous frontal eye, and, with a
flashing glance of rage, consumed the rash intruder on his solitude.
Such is the legend which supplies the closing scene of the life of
K&#257;ma, a life that is celebrated, as March begins, with several
days&rsquo; rejoicing in every town and village of Southern India. The
writer had seen the heap of bricks that support the K&#257;ma pillar in
a village which he visited a few months after first landing in India.
As March came round, he saw them in whatever village his work brought
him, and the legend was impressed on his memory by a case in court, in
which the momentous word &lsquo;K&#257;madakshinasivalingamedai&rsquo;
(or the high place of the emblem of Siva who consumed K&#257;ma) was
pronounced by the various witnesses. It was not, however, till the
spring of 1900 that an opportunity presented itself for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402</a>]</span>witnessing the performance of the K&#257;ma
mystery. The time of representation was the night, the playtime for old
and young in India. It has this special advantage, from a theatrical
point of view, that everything in a village street takes on an
adventitious beauty. The heaps of dust, the ragged huts, lose their
prominence, the palm trees become beautiful, and the tower of the
temple grows in majesty. Everything that is ugly or incongruous seems
to disappear, till the fa&ccedil;ade of a wealthy Hindu&rsquo;s house
wears the dignity of the old Grecian palace proscenium. The rag torches
give a soft strong light, that adds effect to the spangled and laced
robes of the actors, and leaves the auditory in semi-darkness, quite in
accordance with Wagnerian stage tradition. K&#257;ma was represented in
full dress, with a towering, crocketed, gilded mitre or helmet, such as
is worn by the images of South Indian gods. He is not like the
unadorned Eros of the Greeks, and he shows his Indian blood by the
green which paints the upper half of his face. K&#257;ma had the bow of
sugar-cane, and Rathi, otherwise dressed like a wealthy Hindu bride,
also bore a smaller bow of the same. The buffoon must not be omitted.
He figures in every Indian play, and here, besides the distinction of a
girdle of massive cow bells gracefully supporting his paunch, he showed
his connection with this love drama by a small bow of sugar-cane
fastened upright, by one tip, to the peak of a high dunce&rsquo;s cap.
The play began by K&#257;ma boastfully, and at great length, announcing
his intention of disturbing Siva&rsquo;s penance. Rathi did her best to
dissuade him, but every argument she could use only stirred up his
pride, and made him more determined on the adventure. The dialogue was
sometimes sustained by the characters themselves; sometimes they sang
with dreadful harshness; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href=
"#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>sometimes they but swayed to and
fro, as if in a Roman <i>mimus</i>, while the best voice in the company
sang their songs for them. Now and then, the musicians would break into
a chorus, which strikingly recalled, but for the absence of dancing,
the Greek tragic chorus, especially in their idea of inevitable
destiny, and in their lamentations over the disastrous end of the
undertaking. Meanwhile, the buffoon played his part with more or less
success, and backed up the astonishingly skilful and witty acting of
the players, who provided the comic relief. In most Tamil dramas the
action of the play is now and again suspended, while one or more
comedians stroll on to the stage, and amuse the audience by a
v&#275;sham, <i>i.e.</i>, an impersonation of different well-known
street characters representing men (and women) not only of different
castes, but of different nations. Needless to say, the parts they play
have little or nothing to do with the subject of the drama, but they
afford great scope for delineation of character. There is not, of
course, in Southern India, the uniformity in dress that we notice in
England of the present day. A man&rsquo;s trade, profession, religion,
and sect are expressed by his dress and ornament&mdash;or lack of both.
To mention three of the different v&#275;shangal shown on this
occasion, there were a Mahrattah tattooing-woman, a north country
fakir, and a man and woman of the Malsar caste, each of the parts being
dressed to perfection, and admirably sustained. The Malsars are a low
caste, and employed in certain parts as bearers of announcements of
death (written on palm leaves) from the family of the deceased to
relatives at a distance. As they hobbled about, bending over their
short crooked crutch sticks, with turbans of twisted straw and bark,
and girt with scanty and dirty sackcloth kilts, they would have made a
mummy laugh; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>and they were equally mirth-provoking when they
broke into a rough song and dance peculiar to chucklers
(leather-workers) when more than usually intoxicated. When K&#257;ma
had finally declared his unalterable determination to engage in his
contest with Siva&mdash;a point which was only reached after discussion
almost as interminable as a dialogue of Euripides&mdash;the performers,
and part of the audience, moved off in a procession, which slowly
perambulated the town, and halted for prayer before the village temple.
The &lsquo;stage wait&rsquo; was filled up by some simple playing and
singing by a few local amateurs. This brought on the climax of the
tragedy. The K&#257;ma stake, to give it an appropriate English name,
was now ready. This was a slight stake or pole, a little above a
man&rsquo;s height, planted among a few bricks, and made inflammable by
a thatching or coating of cholum straw bound round it. The top of this
straw pillar was composed of a separate sheaf. When all was ready, and
the chorus had sung a strain expressive of grief at K&#257;ma&rsquo;s
doom, a rocket, representing Siva&rsquo;s fiery glance, shot along a
string, and (with some external assistance) lighted the K&#257;ma
stake, thus closely following the procedure in an Italian church
festival. The player who represented K&#257;ma now retired into the
background, as he was supposed to be dead, and the rest, hopping and
dancing, circled slowly round the fire wailing for his fate. It seemed
to be a matter of special import to the audience that the stake should
be completely consumed. This was an omen of prosperity in the coming
year. The funeral dance round the fire continued for a long while, and,
when it was but a short time to sunrise, the mummers were still beating
their breasts round the smouldering ashes. It seemed that, though some
of the songs were composed for the occasion, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>a
great part of the play was traditional, and the audience knew what to
expect at any given period in the performance. At one stage it was
whispered that now the giant would come in, and lift up a sheep with
his teeth. In a few moments he made his appearance, and proved to be a
highly comic monster. His arms, legs, and body were tightly swathed in
neatly twisted straw ropes, leaving only his feet and hands bare. His
head was covered by a huge canvas mask, flat on front and back, so that
the actor had the appearance of having introduced his head into the
empty shell of some gigantic crab. On the flat front of this mask-dial
was painted a terrible giant&rsquo;s face with portentous tusks. Thus
equipped, the giant skipped round the various characters, to the terror
of the buffoon, brandishing a quarter-staff, and executing vigorous
<i>moulinets</i>. An unwilling sheep was pushed into the ring, and the
giant, after much struggling, tossed the animal bodily over his head
with a dexterous fling that convinced most of the onlookers that he had
really performed the feat with his teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Malava.</b>&mdash;The Malavas or Mala Bh&#333;vis are a small
cultivating caste in South Canara, &ldquo;the members of which were
formerly hunters and fishermen. They profess Vaishnavism, and employ
Shivalli Br&#257;hmans as their priests. Hanum&#257;n is their
favourite deity. Like the Bants and other castes of Tuluva, they are
divided into exogamous septs called balis, and they have the dh&#257;re
form of marriage. They speak Canarese.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

said to be really M&#333;gers, who have separated from the fishing

<p><b>Malay&#257;li.</b>&mdash;The Malay&#257;lis or Malai&#257;lis,
whom I examined in the Salem district, dwell on the summits and slopes
of the Shevaroy hills, and earn their living by cultivating grain, and
working on coffee estates. Suspicious and superstitious to a degree,
they openly expressed their fear that I was the dreaded settlement
officer, and had come to take possession of their lands in the name of
the Government, and transport them to the Andaman islands (the Indian
penal settlement). When I was engaged in the innocent occupation of
photographing a village, the camera was mistaken for a surveying
instrument, and a protest raised. Many of them, while willing to part
with their ornaments of the baser metals, were loth to sell or let me
see their gold and silver jewelry, from fear lest I should use it
officially as evidence of their too prosperous condition. One man told
me to my face that he would rather have his throat cut than submit to
my measuring operations, and fled precipitately. The women stolidly
refused to entrust themselves in my hands. Nor would they bring their
children (unwashed specimens of brown humanity) to me, lest they should
fall sick under the influence of my evil eye.</p>
<p>In the account which follows I am largely indebted to Mr. H.
LeFanu&rsquo;s admirable, and at times amusing, Manual of the Salem
district.</p>
<p>The word Malai&#257;li denotes inhabitant of the hills (malai = hill
or mountain). The Malai&#257;lis have not, however, like the Todas of
the Nilgiris, any claim to be considered as an ancient hill tribe, but
are a Tamil-speaking people, who migrated from the plains to the hills
in comparatively recent times. As a shrewd, but unscientific observer
put it concisely to me, they are Tamils of the plains with the addition
of a kambli or blanket; which kambli is a luxury denied to the females,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>but does duty for males, young and old, in the
triple capacity of great coat, waterproof, and blanket. According to
tradition, the Malai&#257;lis originally belonged to the Vell&#257;la
caste of cultivators, and emigrated from the sacred city of
K&#257;nchipuram (Conjeeveram) to the hills about ten generations ago,
when Muhammadan rule was dominant in Southern India. When they left
K&#257;nchi, they took with them, according to their story, three
brothers, of whom the eldest came to the Shevaroy hills, the second to
the Kollaimalais, and the youngest to the Pachaimalais (green hills).
The Malai&#257;lis of the Shevaroys are called the Peria (big)
Malai&#257;lis, those of the Kollaimalais the Chinna (little)
Malai&#257;lis. According to another version &ldquo;the Malai&#257;li
deity Karir&#257;man, finding himself uncomfortable at K&#257;nchi,
took up a new abode. Three of his followers, named Periyanan,
Naduvanan, and Chinnanan (the eldest, the middle-man, and the youngest)
started with their families to follow him from K&#257;nchi, and came to
the Salem district, where they took different routes, Periyanan going
to the Shevaroys, Naduvanan to the Pachaimalais and Anj&#363;r hills,
and Chinnanan to Manjav&#257;di.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A further version of the legendary origin of the Malai&#257;lis of
the Trichinopoly district is given by Mr. F. R. Hemingway, who writes
as follows. &ldquo;Their traditions are embodied in a collection of
songs (n&#257;ttukattu). The story goes that they are descended from a
priest of Conjeeveram, who was the brother of the king, and, having
quarrelled with the latter, left the place, and entered this country
with his three sons and daughters. The country was then ruled by
V&#275;dans and Vell&#257;lans, who resisted the new-comers. But
&lsquo;the conch-shell blew and the quoit cut,&rsquo; and the invaders
won the day. They then spread themselves about the hills, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>eldest son (Periyanan), whose name was Sadaya
Kavundan, selecting the Shevaroys in Salem, the second son (Naduvanan,
the middle brother) the Pachaimalais, and the youngest (Chinnanan) the
Kollaimalais. They married women of the country, Periyanan taking a
Kaik&#333;lan, Naduvanan a V&#275;dan, and Chinnanan a &lsquo;D&#275;va
Indra&rsquo; Pallan. They gave their sister in marriage to a Tottiyan
stranger, in exchange for some food supplied by him after their battle
with the men of the country. Some curious customs survive, which are
pointed to in support of this story. Thus, the women of the Pachaimalai
Malaiy&#257;lis put aside a portion of each meal in honour of their
V&#275;dan ancestors before serving their husbands, and, at their
marriages, they wear a comb, which is said to have been a
characteristic ornament of the V&#275;dans. Bridegrooms place a sword
and an arrow in the marriage booth, to typify the hunting habits of the
V&#275;dans, and their own conquest of the country. The Malaiy&#257;lis
of the Kollaimalais are addressed by Pallan women as brother-in-law
(macch&#257;n), though the Malaiy&#257;lis do not relish this. It is
also said that Tottiyan men regard Malaiy&#257;lis as their
brothers-in-law, and always treat them kindly, and that the Tottiyan
women regard the Malaiy&#257;lis as their brothers, but treat them very
coldly, in remembrance of their having sold their sister &lsquo;for a
mess of pottage.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The account, which the Malai&#257;lis of the Jav&#257;di hills in
North Arcot give of their origin, is as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5544src" href="#xd21e5544" name="xd21e5544src">37</a> &ldquo;In
S.S. 1055 (1132 A.D.) some of the V&#275;dars of Kangundi asked that
wives should be given them by the Karaikk&#257;t Vell&#257;las of
Conjeeveram. They were scornfully refused, and in anger kidnapped seven
young Vell&#257;la maidens, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href=
"#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>whom they carried away to
Kangundi. To recover them, seven Vell&#257;la men set out with seven
dogs, leaving instructions with their wives that, if the dogs returned
alone, they should consider that they had perished, and should cause
the funeral ceremonies to be performed. Arriving at the
P&#257;l&#257;r, they found the river in flood, and crossed it with
difficulty ; but their dogs, after swimming half way, turned back and
returned to Conjeeveram. The men, however, continued their journey, and
killed the V&#275;dars who had taken away their maidens, after which
they went back to their homes, but found that they had been given up as
lost, their wives had become widows, their funeral ceremonies
performed, and they were in consequence outcastes. Under these
circumstances, they contracted marriages with some V&#275;dar women,
and retired to the Jav&#257;dis, where they took to cultivation, and
became the ancestors of the Malai&#257;li caste. This account has been
preserved by the Malai&#257;lis in a small palm-leaf book.&rdquo; There
is, Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5549src" href=
"#xd21e5549" name="xd21e5549src">38</a> a tradition in the South Arcot
district that &ldquo;the hills were inhabited by V&#275;dans, and that
the Malai&#257;lis killed the men, and wedded the women; and at
marriages a gun is still fired in the air to represent the death of the
V&#275;dan husband.&rdquo; The Malai&#257;lis returned themselves, at
the last census, as Karaikk&#257;t Vell&#257;las. The Malai&#257;lis of
South Arcot call themselves Kongu Vell&#257;las. All the branches of
the community agree in saying that they are Vell&#257;lans, who
emigrated from K&#257;nchipuram, bringing with them their god
Karir&#257;man, and, at the weddings of the Kalr&#257;yans in South
Arcot, the presiding priest sings a kind of chant just before the
t&#257;li is tied, which begins with the words K&#257;nchi, the
(sacred) place, and Karir&#257;man in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb410" href="#pb410" name="pb410">410</a>]</span>front. Copper
s&#257;sanams show that the migration occurred at least as early as the
beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The Malai&#257;lis of the Shevaroys call themselves
K&#257;nchimandalam. Many, at the last census, returned themselves as
Vell&#257;la and K&#257;r&#257;lan. Malakk&#257;ran and Mala
N&#257;yakkan are also used as synonyms for Malai&#257;li. All have
Goundan as their second name, which is universally used in hailing
them. The first name is sometimes derived from a Hindu god, and my
notes record Mr. Green, Mr. Black, Mr. Little, Mr. Short, Mr. Large,
and Mr. Big nose.</p>
<p>As regards the conditions under which the Malai&#257;lis of the
Salem district hold land, I learn from the Manual that, in 1866, the
Collector fixed an area around each village for the cultivation of the
Malai&#257;lis exclusively, and, in view to prevent aggression on the
part of the planters, had the boundaries of these areas surveyed and
demarcated. This area is known as the &ldquo;village green.&rdquo; With
this survey the old system of charging the Malai&#257;lis on ploughs
and hoes appears to have been discontinued, and they are now charged at
one rupee per acre on the extent of their holdings. The lands within
the green are given under the ordinary darakh&#257;st<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5558src" href="#xd21e5558" name="xd21e5558src">39</a> rules to
the Malai&#257;lis, but outside it they are sold under the special
waste land rules of 1863. In 1870 the Board of Revenue decided that,
where the lands within the green are all occupied, and the
Malai&#257;lis require more land for cultivation, land outside the
limits of the green may be given them under the ordinary darakh&#257;st
rules. In 1871 it was discovered that the planters tried to get lands
outside the green by making the Malai&#257;lis first apply for it,
thereby evading the waste land rules. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb411" href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>Board then ordered
that, if there was reason to suspect that a Malai&#257;li was applying
for lands outside the green on account of the planters, the patta (deed
of lease) might be refused.</p>
<p>Subscribing vaguely to the Hindu religion, the Malai&#257;lis, who
believe that their progenitors wore the sacred thread, give a nominal
allegiance to both Siva and Vishnu, as well as to a number of minor
deities, and believe in the efficacy of a thread to ward off sickness
and attacks by devils or evil spirits. &ldquo;In the year 1852,&rdquo;
Mr. LeFanu writes, &ldquo;a searching enquiry into the traditions,
customs, and origin of these Malai&#257;lis was made. They then stated
that smearing the face with ashes indicates the religion of Siva, and
putting n&#257;mam that of Vishnu, but that there is no difference
between the two religions; that, though Sivar&#257;tri sacred to Siva,
and Srir&#257;manavami and G&#333;kul&#257;shtami sacred to Vishnu,
appear outwardly to denote a difference, there is really none. Though
they observe the Saturdays of the month Perat&#257;si sacred to Vishnu,
still worship is performed without reference to Vishnu or Siva. They
have, indeed, certain observances, which would seem to point to a
division into Vaishnavas and Saivas, the existence of which they deny;
as for instance, some, out of respect to Siva, abstain from sexual
intercourse on Sundays and Mondays; and others, for the sake of Vishnu,
do the same on Fridays and Saturdays. So, too, offerings are made to
Vishnu on Fridays and Saturdays, and to Siva on Sundays and Mondays;
but they denied the existence of sects among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Kalr&#257;yans,&rdquo; Mr. Francis writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5567src" href="#xd21e5567" name=
"xd21e5567src">40</a> &ldquo;are very many shrines to the lesser gods.
The Malai&#257;lis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412"
name="pb412">412</a>]</span>themselves do the p&#363;ja (worship). The
deities include M&#257;riamma, Draupadi, and many other village
goddesses. In some of the temples are placed the prehistoric celts and
other stone implements which are found on these hills. The people do
not understand what these are, and reverence them accordingly. The
practice of taking oaths before these shrines to settle disputes is
common. The party makes a solemn affidavit of the truth of his case in
the presence of the god, holding some burning camphor in his hand.
Having made his statement, he blows out the flame to signify that, if
he is lying, the god is welcome to snuff him out in the same sudden
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In April 1896, I paid a visit to the picturesquely situated village
of Kili&#363;r, not far distant from the town of Yercaud, on the
occasion of a religious festival. The villagers were discovered, early
in the morning, painting pseudo-sect-marks on their foreheads with blue
and pink coal-tar dyes, with the assistance of hand looking-glasses of
European manufacture purchased at the weekly market, and decorating
their turbans and ears with the leafy stems of <i>Artemisia
austriaca</i>, var. <i>orientalis</i>, and hedge-roses. The scene of
the ceremonial was in a neighbouring sacred grove of lofty forest
trees, wherein were two hut temples, of which one contained images of
the goddess Draupadi and eight minor deities, the other images of
Perum&#257;l and his wife. All the gods and goddesses were represented
by human figures of brass and clay. Two processional cars were gaily
decorated with plantain leaves and flags, some made in Germany. As the
villagers arrived, they prostrated themselves before the temples, and
whiled away the time, till the serious business of the day began, in
gossiping with their friends, and partaking of light refreshment
purchased <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>from the fruit and sweetmeat sellers, who were
doing a brisk trade. At 10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> the proceedings
were enlivened by a band of music, which played at intervals throughout
the performance, and the gods were decorated with flowers and jewelry.
An hour later, p&#363;ja was done to the stone image of the god
Vign&#275;swara, within a small shrine built of slabs of rock. Before
this idol cooked rice was offered, and camphor burnt. The plantain
stems, with leaves, were tied to a tree in the vicinity of the temples,
and cooked rice and cocoanuts placed beneath the tree. A man holding a
sword, issued forth, and, in unison with the collected assemblage,
screamed out &ldquo;G&#333;vinda, G&#333;vinda&rdquo; (the name of
their god). The plantain stems were next removed from the tree, carried
in procession with musical honours, and placed before the threshold of
one of the temples. Then some men appeared on the scene to the cry of
&ldquo;G&#333;vinda,&rdquo; bearing in one hand a light, and ringing a
bell held in the other. Holy water was sprinkled over the plantain
stems, and p&#363;ja done to the god Perum&#257;l by offering
s&#257;mai (grain) and burning camphor. Outside one of the temples a
cloth was spread on the ground, and the images of Draupadi and other
deities placed therein. From the other temple Perum&#257;l and his wife
were brought forth in state, and placed on two cars. A yellow powder
was distributed among the crowd, and smeared over the face. A cocoanut
was broken, and camphor burnt before Perum&#257;l. Then all the gods,
followed by the spectators, were carried in procession round the grove,
and a man, becoming inspired and seized with a fine religious frenzy,
waved a sword wildly around him, but with due respect for his own
bodily safety, and pointed it in a threatening manner at the crowd.
Asked, as an oracle, whether the omens were propitious to the village,
he gave vent to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414"
name="pb414">414</a>]</span>the oracular (and true) response that for
three years there would be a scarcity of rain, and that there would be
famine in the land, and consequent suffering. This performance
concluded, a bamboo pole was erected, bearing a pulley at the top, with
which cocoanuts and plantains were connected by a string. By means of
this string, the fruits were alternately raised and lowered, and men,
armed with sticks, tried to hit them, while turmeric water was dashed
in their faces just as they were on the point of striking. The fruits,
being at last successfully hit, were received as a prize by the winner.
The gods were then taken back to their temple, and three men, overcome
by a mock convulsive seizure, were brought to their senses by stripes
on the back administered with a rope by the p&#363;jari (officiating
priest). A sheep being produced, mantrams (prayers) were recited over
it. The p&#363;j&#257;ri, going to a pool close by, bathed, and smeared
turmeric powder over his face. A pretence was made to cut the
sheep&rsquo;s throat, and blood drawn with a knife. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri, after sucking the blood, returned to the pool, and
indulged in a ceremonial ablution, while the unhappy sheep was escorted
to the village, and eventually eaten at a banquet by the villagers and
their guests.</p>
<p>An annual festival, in honour of the god S&#275;rvar&#257;yan, is
held at the shrine on the summit of the Sh&#275;var&#257;yan hill, past
which a stream flows. At this festival, in 1904, &ldquo;on one side of
the temple, two long rows of fruit, flower, and grain stalls were
erected. Supported on two posts was a merry-go-round with wooden seats
instead of boats, the cost of a ride thereon being a quarter of an
anna. Women carried their children to a pool of water beside the
temple, known as the wishing well, and, after sprinkling some of the
holy fluid on themselves and their offspring, spoke their wishes aloud,
fully believing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415"
name="pb415">415</a>]</span>that they would be granted. Suddenly there
was a beating of drums, and blowing of trumpets, and horns, which
announced the time when the god was to be brought out, and shown to the
people, who made a rush to the temple, to obtain a good view. The god
was carried by two priests robed in white, with garlands of jasmine
round their necks. Then followed two other priests, clothed in the same
manner, who bore the goddess on their shoulders. Another carried the
holy water and fire in silver vessels from the temple, sprinkling the
former in front of the deities, and the latter they passed before them.
These services being completed, each deity was placed on a wooden horse
with gay trappings, and carried to the top of the hill, where they were
met with shouts from the people. The deities were placed in a
palanquin, and carried to the four points of the hill, and, at each
point, the men put their burden down, and cocoanuts were broken in
front of them, and fruit, grain, and even copper coins were scattered.
Those who wished to take the vow to be faithful to their god had to
receive fifteen lashes on their bare backs with a stout leather thong,
administered by the chief priest. When questioned about the pain, they
answered, &lsquo;Oh, it is nothing. It is just like being scratched by
an ant.&rsquo; The god and goddess were then carried back into the
temple.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5592src" href="#xd21e5592"
name="xd21e5592src">41</a></p>
<p>Of this festival, as celebrated in May, 1908, the following account
has been given.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5597src" href="#xd21e5597"
name="xd21e5597src">42</a> &ldquo;The annual Malay&#257;li festival was
held on the top of Sh&#275;var&#257;yan. It was the occasion of the
marriage anniversary of the god S&#275;rvar&#257;yan, after whom the
Shevaroy Hills have been named, to a goddess, the presiding deity of
the Cauvery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>river. This hill is believed by the
Malay&#257;lis to be the place where their god S&#275;rvar&#257;yan
lived, died, and was buried. On one side of the hill, the temple of the
god nestles in the midst of a sacred grove of trees. Some say that
there is a secret tunnel leading from the shrine to another part of the
hill, and a second one opening lower down into Bear&rsquo;s Cave. It
was an interesting sight to watch visitors and devotees as they came
from the four quarters of the Shevaroys. A few hill-men danced a
serpentine dance, stepping to the music supplied by village drums, and
occasional shrill blasts from the horns. Huge cauldrons were sending up
blue wreaths of smoke into the sky, which, it was explained to us,
contained food to be dispensed as charity to the poor. The temple yard
was hung with flowers and leaves, with which also the rude structure
known as the temple gate was decorated. On the summit of the hill,
wares of all sorts and conditions were displayed to tempt purchasers.
The articles for sale consisted of fruits, palm sugar, cocoanuts,
monkey nuts, and other nuts, mirrors which proved very popular among
the fair sex, fancy boxes, coloured powder for caste marks, cloth bags,
strings of sweet-scented flowers, rattles for children, etc.... We were
startled by hearing the noise of loud drums and shrill trumpets, and
were told that the god was about to be brought forth. This was
accompanied by shouting, clapping, and the beating of drums. The god
and goddess were placed in two chariots, bedecked with flowers, jewels
and tapestries, and umbrellas and fans also figured prominently. The
procession passed up to the left of the temple, the deities being
supported on the shoulders of sturdy Malay&#257;lis. As the people met
it, they threw fruit, nuts, and cocoanut water after the cars. The god
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=

(priest) in the triumphal car, and was led with the goddess to that
part of the hill from which the Cauvery can best be seen. Here the
procession halted while the priest recited some incantations. Then it
marched down the hill, sometimes resting the god on cairns specially
built for the purpose, from where a view of the outlying villages is
obtained. The belief is that, as the god glances at these villages, he
invokes blessings on them, and the villagers will always live in
prosperity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Mr. W. Mahon Daly, I am indebted for the following account of a
Malai&#257;li bull dance, at which he was present as an eye-witness.
&ldquo;It is the custom on the Shevaroy hills, as well as the plains,
to have a bull dance after the Pongal festival, and I had the pleasure
of witnessing one in a Malai&#257;li village. It was held in an open
enclosure called the manthay, adjoining the village. It faces the
M&#257;riamma shrine, and is the place of resort on festive occasions.
The village councils, marriages, and other ceremonies are held here. On
our arrival, we were courteously invited to sit under a wide spreading
fig-tree. The bull dance would literally mean a bull dancing, but I
give the translation of the Tamil &lsquo;yerothu-attum,&rsquo; the word
attum meaning dance. This is a sport which is much in vogue among the
Malai&#257;lis, and is celebrated with much &eacute;clat immediately
after Pongal, this being the principal festival observed by them. No
doubt they have received the custom from those in the plains. A
shooting excursion follows as the next sport, and, if they be so
fortunate as to hunt down a wild boar or deer, or any big game, a
second bull dance is got up. We were just in time to see the
tam&#257;sha (spectacle). The manthay was becoming crowded, a regular
influx of spectators, mostly women <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418"
href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>arrayed in their best cloths,
coming in from the neighbouring villages. These were marshalled in a
circle round the manthay, all standing. I was told that they were not
invited, but that it was customary for them to pour in of their own
accord when any sports or ceremonial took place in a village; and the
inhabitants of the particular village were prepared to expect a large
company, whom they fed on such occasions. After the company had
collected, drums were beaten, and the long brass bugles were blown;
and, just at this juncture, we saw an elderly Malai&#257;li bring from
his hut a coil of rope made of leather, and hand it over to the
p&#363;j&#257;ri or priest in charge of the temple. The latter placed
it in front of the shrine, worshipped it thrice, some of the villagers
following suit, and, after offering incense, delivered it to a few
respectable village men, who in turn made it over to a lot of
Malai&#257;li men, whose business it was to attach it to the bulls.
This rope the oldest inhabitant of the village had the right to keep.
The bulls had been previously selected, and penned alongside of the
manthay, from which they were brought one by one, and tied with the
rope, leaving an equal length on either side. The rope being fixed on,
the bull was brought to the manthay, held on both sides by any number
who were willing, or as many as the rope would permit. More than
fifteen on either side held on to a bull, which was far too many, for
the animal had not the slightest chance of making a dart or plunge at
the man in front, who was trying to provoke it by using a long bamboo
with a skin attached to the end. When the bull was timid, and avoided
his persecutors, he was hissed and hooted by those behind, and, if
these modes of provocation failed to rouse his anger, he was simply
dragged to and fro by main force, and let loose when his strength was
almost exhausted. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419"
name="pb419">419</a>]</span>dozen or more bulls are taken up and down
the manthay, and the tam&#257;sha is over. When the manthay happens to
have a slope, the Malai&#257;lis have very little control over the
bull, and, in some instances, I have seen them actually dragged
headlong to the ground at the expense of a few damaged heads. The
spectators, and all the estate coolies who were present, were fed that
night, and slept in the village. If a death occurs in the village a few
days before the festival, I am told that the dance is postponed for a
week. This certainly, as far as I know, is not the custom in the
plains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man of highest rank is the guru, who is invited to settle
disputes in villages, to which he comes, on pony-back or on foot, with
an umbrella over him, and accompanied by music. The office of guru is
hereditary, and, when he dies, his son succeeds him, unless he is a
minor, in which case the brother of the deceased man steps into his
shoes. If, in sweeping the hut, the broom touches any one, or when a
Malai&#257;li has been kicked by a European or released from prison, he
must be received back into his caste. For this purpose he goes to the
guru, who takes him to the temple, where a screen is put up between the
guru and the applicant for restoration of caste privileges. Holy water
is dedicated to the sw&#257;mi(god), by the guru, and a portion thereof
drunk by the man, who prostrates himself before the guru, and
subsequently gives a feast of pork, mutton, and other delicacies. The
Malai&#257;lis, it may be noted, will eat sheep, pigs, fowls, various
birds, and black monkeys.</p>
<p>Each village on the Shevaroys has its own headman, an honorary
appointment, carrying with it the privilege of an extra share of the
good things, when a feast is being held. A Kang&#257;ni is appointed to
do duty under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>the headman, and receives annually from every
hut two ballams of grain. When disputes occur, <i>e.g.</i>, between two
brothers regarding a woman or partition of property, the headman
summons a panch&#257;yat (village council), which has the power to
inflict fines in money, sheep, etc., according to the gravity of the
offence. For every group of ten villages there is a Pattak&#257;ran
(head of a division), who is expected to attend on the occasion of
marriages and car festivals. A bridegroom has to give him eight days
before his marriage a rupee, a packet of betel leaves, and half a
measure of nuts. Serving under the Pattak&#257;ran is the
Maniak&#257;ran, whose duty it is to give notice of a marriage to the
ten villages, and to summon the villagers thereto.</p>
<p>In April 1898, on receipt of news of a wedding at a distant village,
I proceeded thither through coffee estates rich with white flowers
bursting into flower under the grateful influence of a thunderstorm.
<i>En route</i>, a view was obtained of the Golden Horn, an overhanging
rock with a drop of a thousand feet, down which the Malai&#257;lis
swing themselves in search for honey. On the track through the jungle a
rock, known from the fancied resemblance of the holes produced by
weathering to hoof-marks as the kudre panji (horse&rsquo;s footprints),
was passed. Concerning this rock, the legend runs that a horse jumped
on to it at one leap from the top of the Sh&#275;var&#257;yan hill, and
at the next leap reached the plains at the foot of the hills. The
village, which was the scene of the festivities, was, like other
Malai&#257;li villages, made up of detached bee-hive huts of bamboo,
thatched with palm-leaves and grass, and containing a central room
surrounded by a verandah&mdash;the home of pigs, goats, and fowls.
Other huts, of similar bee-hive shape, but smaller, were used as
storehouses for the grain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href=
"#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span>collected at the harvest-season.
These grain-stores have no entrance, and the thatched roof has to be
removed, to take out the grain for use. Tiled roofs, such as are common
in the Badaga villages on the N&#299;lgiris, are forbidden, as their
use would be an innovation, which would excite the anger of the
Malai&#257;li gods. The Malai&#257;lis have religious scruples against
planing or smoothing with an adze the trees which they fell. The area
of lands used to be ascertained by guesswork, not measurement, and much
opposition was made to an attempt to introduce chain measurements, the
Malai&#257;lis expressing themselves willing to pay any rent imposed,
if their lands were not measured. Huts built on piles contain the
flocks, which, during the day, are herded in pens which are removable,
and, by moving the pens, the villagers manage to get the different
parts of their fields manured. Round the village a low wall usually
runs, and, close by, are the coffee, tobacco, and other cultivated
crops. Outside the village, beneath a lofty tree, was a small stone
shrine, capped with a stone slab, wherein were stacked a number of
neolithic celts, which the Malai&#257;lis reverence as thunderbolts
from heaven. I was introduced to the youthful and anxious bridegroom,
clad in his wedding finery, who stripped before the assembled crowd, in
order that I might record his jewelry and garments. On the first day,
the bridegroom, accompanied by his relations, takes the modest dowry of
grain and money (usually five rupees) to the bride&rsquo;s village, and
arranges for the performance of the nalangu ceremony on the following
day. If the bride and bridegroom belong to the same village, this
ceremony is performed by the pair seated on a cot. Otherwise it is
performed by each separately. The elders of the village take a few
drops of castor-oil, and rub it into the heads <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>of
the bride and bridegroom; afterwards washing the oil off with punac
(<i>Bassia</i> oil-cake) and alum water. One of the elders then dips
betel-leaves and arugum-pillu (<i>Cynodon Dactylon</i>) in milk, and
with them describes a circle round the heads of the young couple, who
do obeisance by bowing their heads. The proceedings wind up with a
feast of pork and other luxuries. On the following day, the ceremony of
tying the t&#257;li (marriage emblem) round the bride&rsquo;s neck is
performed. The bride, escorted by her party, comes to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s village, and remains outside it, while the
bridegroom brings a light, a new mat, and three bundles of betel leaves
and half a measure of areca nuts, which are distributed among the
crowd. The happy pair then enter the village, accompanied by music.
Beneath a pandal (booth) there is a stone representing the god, marked
with the n&#257;mam, and decorated with burning lamps and painted
earthen pots. Before this stone the bride and bridegroom seat
themselves in the presence of the guru, who is seated on a raised dais.
Flowers are distributed among the wedding guests, and the t&#257;li,
made of gold, is tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck. This done, the feet
of both bride and bridegroom are washed with alum water, and presents
of small coin received. The contracting parties then walk three times
round the stone, before which they prostrate themselves, and receive
the blessing of the assembled elders. The ceremony concluded, they go
round the village, riding on the same pony. The proceedings again
terminate with a feast. I gather that the bride lives apart from her
husband for eleven or fifteen days, during which time he is permitted
to visit her at meal times, with the object, as my interpreter
expressed it, of &ldquo;finding out if the bride loves her husband or
not. If she does <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423"
name="pb423">423</a>]</span>not love him, she is advised by the guru
and headman to do so, because there are many cases in which the girls,
after marriage, if they are matured, go away with other Malai&#257;lis.
If this matter comes to the notice of the guru, she says that she does
not like to live with him. After enquiry, the husband is permitted to
marry another girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious custom prevailing among the Malai&#257;lis, which
illustrates the Hindu love of offspring, is thus referred to by Mr. Le
Fanu. &ldquo;The sons, when mere children, are married to mature
females, and the father-in-law of the bride assumes the performance of
the procreative function, thus assuming for himself and his son a
descendant to take them out of Put. When the putative father comes of
age, and, in their turn, his wife&rsquo;s male offspring are married,
he performs for them the same office which his father did for him.
Thus, not only is the religious idea involved in the words Putra and
Kum&#257;ran carried out, but also the premature strain on the
generative faculties, which this tradition entails, is avoided. The
accommodation is reciprocal, and there is something on physiological
grounds to recommend it.&rdquo; Putra means literally one who saves
from Put, a hell into which those who have not produced a son fall.
Hindus believe that a son can, by the performance of certain rites,
save the souls of his ancestors from this place of torture. Hence the
anxiety of every Hindu to get married, and beget male offspring.
Kum&#257;ran is the second stage in the life of an individual, which is
divided into infancy, childhood, manhood, and old age. Writing to me
recently, a Native official assures me that &ldquo;the custom of
linking a boy in marriage to a mature female, though still existing,
has, with the advance of the times, undergone a slight yet decent
change. The father-in-law <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href=
"#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>of the bride has relieved himself
of the awkward predicament into which the custom drove him, and now
leaves the performance of the procreative function to others accepted
by the bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Widow remarriage among the Peria Malai&#257;lis is, I am informed,
forbidden, though widows are permitted to contract irregular alliances.
But, writing concerning the Malai&#257;lis of the Dharmapuri t&#257;luk
of the Salem district, Mr. Le Fanu states that &ldquo;it is almost
imperative on a widow to marry again. Even at eighty years of age, a
widow is not exempted from this rule, which nothing but the most
persistent obstinacy on her part can evade. It is said that, in case a
widow be not remarried at once, the Pattak&#257;r sends for her to his
own house, to avoid which the women consent to re-enter the state of
bondage.&rdquo; Of the marriage customs of the Malai&#257;lis of the
Jav&#257;di hills the same author writes that &ldquo;these hills are
inhabited by Malai&#257;lis, who style themselves Vell&#257;lars and
Pachai Vell&#257;lars, the latter being distinguished by the fact that
their females are not allowed to tattoo themselves, or tie their hair
in the knot called &lsquo;kondai.&rsquo; The two classes do not
intermarry. In their marriage ceremonies they dispense with the service
of a Br&#257;hman. Monday is the day chosen for the commencement of the
ceremony, and the t&#257;li is tied on the following Friday, the only
essential being that the Monday and Friday concerned must not follow
new-moon days. They are indifferent about choosing a
&lsquo;lakkinam&rsquo; (muh&#363;rtham or auspicious day) for the
commencement of the marriage, or for tying the t&#257;li. Widows are
allowed to remarry. When a virgin or a widow has to be married, the
selection of a husband is not left to the woman concerned, or to her
parents. It is the duty of the &#362;rgoundan to inquire what
marriageable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>women there may be in the village, and then to
summon the P&#257;ttan, or headman of the caste, to the spot. The
latter, on his arrival, convenes a panch&#257;yat of the residents,
and, with their assistance, selects a bridegroom. The parents of the
happy couple then fix the wedding day, and the ceremony is performed
accordingly. The marriage of a virgin is called
&lsquo;kali&#257;nam&rsquo; or &lsquo;marriage proper&rsquo;; that of a
widow being styled &lsquo;kattigiradu&rsquo; or &lsquo;tying&rsquo;
(<i>cf.</i> Anglice noose, nuptial knot). Adultery is regarded with
different degrees of disfavour according to the social position of the
co-respondents. If a married woman, virgin or widow, commits adultery
with a man of another caste, or if a male Vell&#257;lan commits
adultery with a woman of another caste, the penalty is expulsion from
caste. Where, however, the paramour belongs to the Vell&#257;la caste,
a caste panch&#257;yat is held, and the woman is fined Rs.
3&ndash;8&ndash;9, and the man Rs. 7. After the imposition of the fine,
Br&#257;hman supremacy is recognised, the guru having the privilege of
administering the tirtam, or holy water, to the culprits for their
purification. For the performance of this rite his fee varies from 4
annas to 12 rupees. The tirtam may either be administered by the guru
in person, or may be sent by him to the N&#257;tt&#257;n for the
purpose. The fine imposed on the offenders is payable by their
relatives, however distant; and, if there be no relatives, then the
offenders are transported from their village to a distant place. Where
the adulteress is a married woman, she is permitted to return to her
husband, taking any issue she may have had by her paramour. In special
cases a widow is permitted to marry her deceased husband&rsquo;s
brother. Should a widow remarry, her issue by her former husband belong
to his relatives, and are not transferable to the second husband. The
same rule holds good in successive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426"
href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>remarriages. Where there may
be no relatives of the deceased husband forthcoming to take charge of
the children, the duty of caring for them devolves on the
&#362;rgoundan, who is bound to receive and protect them. The Vellalars
generally bury their dead, except in cases where a woman quick with
child, or a man afflicted with leprosy has died, the bodies in these
cases being burnt. No ceremony is performed at child-birth; but the
little stranger receives a name on the fifteenth day. When a girl
attains puberty, she is relegated to a hut outside the village, where
her food is brought to her, and she is forbidden to leave the hut
either day or night. The same menstrual and death customs are observed
by the Peria Malai&#257;lis, who bury their dead in the equivalent of a
cemetery, and mark the site by a mound of earth and stones. At the time
of the funeral, guns are discharged by a firing party, and, at the
grave, handfuls of earth are, as at a Christian burial service, thrown
over the corpse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a woman among the Malai&#257;lis of the Jav&#257;di hills commits
adultery, the young men of the tribe are said to be let loose on her,
to work their wicked way, after which she is put in a pit filled with
cow-dung and other filth. An old man naively remarked that adultery was
very rare.</p>
<p>At a wedding among the Malai&#257;lis of the South Arcot district,
&ldquo;after the t&#257;li is tied, the happy couple crook their little
fingers together, and a two-anna bit is placed between the fingers, and
water is poured over their hands. The priest offers betel and nut to
Kari R&#257;man, and then a gun is fired into the air.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>The father of a would-be bridegroom among the Malai&#257;lis of the
Y&#275;lagiris, when he hears of the existence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>of a
suitable bride, repairs to her village, with some of his relations, and
seeks out the &#362;rgoundan or headman, between whom and the visitors
mutual embraces are exchanged. The object of the visit is explained,
and the father says that he will abide by the voice of four in the
matter. If the match is fixed up, he gives a feast in honour of the
event. When the visitors enter the future bride&rsquo;s house, the
eldest daughter-in-law of the house appears on the threshold, and takes
charge of the walking-stick of each person who goes in. She then, with
some specially prepared sandal-paste, makes a circular mark on the
foreheads of the guests, and retires. The feast then takes place, and
she again appears before the party retire, and returns the
walking-sticks.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5662src" href="#xd21e5662"
name="xd21e5662src">44</a></p>
<p>At a marriage among the Malai Vell&#257;las of the Coimbatore
district, the bride has to cry during the whole ceremony, which lasts
three days. Otherwise she is considered an &ldquo;ill woman.&rdquo;
When she can no longer produce genuine tears, she must bawl out. If she
does not do this, the bridegroom will not marry her. In the North Arcot
district, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5667src"
href="#xd21e5667" name="xd21e5667src">45</a> &ldquo;a Malai&#257;li
bride is sometimes carried off by force, but this custom is viewed with
much disfavour, and the bridegroom who resorts to it must paint his
face with black and white dots, and carry an old basket filled with
broken pots and other rubbish, holding a torn sieve over him as an
umbrella, before the celebration of the marriage. At the wedding, the
bridegroom gives the girl&rsquo;s father a present of money, and a pile
of firewood sufficient for the two days&rsquo; feast. On the first day
the food consists of rice and dh&#257;l (<i>Cajanus indicus</i>), and
on the second day pork curry is consumed. At sunrise on the third day
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>the bridegroom produces the t&#257;li. A sword
is then laid on the laps of the bridal pair, and the N&#257;tt&#257;n
(headman), or an elderly man blesses the t&#257;li, and gives it to the
bridegroom, who ties it round the bride&rsquo;s neck. Before marriage,
a man has to serve for at least a year in the house of the bride, in
order to receive the consent of her parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The North Arcot Malai&#257;lis,&rdquo; Mr. Stuart writes,
&ldquo;occupy eighteen n&#257;dus or districts. The N&#257;tt&#257;n
(headman) of Kanamalai n&#257;du is called the Periya (big) N&#257;dan,
and is the headman of the caste. He has the power to nominate
N&#257;tt&#257;ns for other n&#257;dus, to call caste panch&#257;yats,
to preside over any such meetings, and to impose fines, and
excommunicate any Malai&#257;li. He can inflict corporal punishment,
such as whipping with a tamarind switch, on those persons who violate
their tribal customs. This power is sometimes delegated by him to the
other N&#257;tt&#257;ns. Of the fines collected, the Periya
N&#257;tt&#257;n takes two shares, and the rest is distributed equally
among the &#362;r&#257;ns (village heads). The village precincts are
considered sacred, and even Br&#257;hmans are desired to walk barefoot
along their alleys. They are both Saivites and Vaishnavites, and
worship K&#257;li and Perum&#257;l, wearing the n&#257;mam and sacred
ashes alike. Their worship is somewhat peculiar, and kept more or less
a mystery. Its chief object is K&#257;li, in whose honour they
celebrate a feast once a year, lasting for fifteen days. During this
time no people of the plains venture near them, believing that no
intruder will ever leave the spot alive. Even the Malai&#257;li women
are studiously debarred from witnessing the rites, and those who take
part in them are not permitted to speak to a woman, even should she be
his wife. The ceremonies take place in the open air, at a particular
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>spot on the hills, where the goddess is to be
adored in the shape of a stone called Vellandisw&#257;mi. The nature of
the rites it is difficult to learn. In the village they worship, also
excluding women, small images of Venkat&#275;swara of Tirupati, which
are carefully concealed in caskets, and not allowed to be seen by
people of other castes. A few bundles of tobacco are buried with the
dead. When any one falls ill, the Malai&#257;lis do not administer
medicine, but send for a p&#363;j&#257;ri, and ask him which god or
goddess the patient had offended. The assessment paid to Government by
them is a fixed charge for each plough or hoe possessed, without
reference to the extent of land cultivated. They collect jungle
produce, particularly the glandular hairs of the fruits of a certain
flower (<i>Mallotus philippinensis</i>), which is used by the
Rang&#257;ris for dyeing silk a rich orange, and the roots of a plant
called shenalinsedi, supposed to possess wonderful medicinal virtues,
curing, among other things, snake-bite.&rdquo; The Malai&#257;lis of
the Jav&#257;di hills in the North Arcot district also earn a living by
felling bamboos and sandal trees.</p>
<p>The Malai&#257;lis snare with nets, and shoot big game&mdash;deer,
tigers, leopards, bears, and pigs&mdash;with guns of European
manufacture. Mr. Le Fanu narrates that, during the Pongal feast, all
the Malai&#257;lis of the Kalr&#257;yans go hunting, or, as they term
it, for parv&#275;ttai. Should the P&#257;laiagar fail to bring
something down, usage requires that the p&#363;j&#257;ri should deprive
him of his kudumi or top-knot. He generally begs himself off the
personal degradation, and a servant undergoes the operation in his
stead. A few years ago, a party of Malai&#257;lis of the Shevaroys went
out shooting with blunderbusses and other quaint weapons, and bagged a
leopard, which they carried on a frame-work, with jaws <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>wide
open and tail erect, round Yercaud, preceded by tom-toms, and with men
dancing around.</p>
<p>The Malai&#257;li men on the Shevaroys wear a turban and brown
kumbli (blanket), which does duty as great coat, mackintosh, and
umbrella. A bag contains their supply of betel and tobacco, and they
carry a bill-hook and gourd water-vessel, and a coffee walking-stick.
As ornaments they wear bangles, rings on the fingers and toes, and in
the nose and ears. The women are tattooed by Korava women who come
round on circuit, on the forehead, outside the orbits, cheeks, arms,
and hands. Golden ornaments adorn their ears and nose, and they also
wear armlets, toe-rings, and bangles, which are sometimes supplemented
by a tooth-pick and ear-scoop pendent from a string round the neck. For
dress, a s&#257;ri made of florid imported cotton fabric is worn. I
have seen women smoking cheroots, made from tobacco locally cultivated,
wrapped up in a leaf of <i>Gmelina arborea</i>. Tattooing is said to be
forbidden among the Malai&#257;lis of the Jav&#257;di hills in North
Arcot.</p>
<p>Concerning the Malai&#257;lis of the Trichinopoly district, Mr. F.
R. Hemingway writes as follows. &ldquo;As far as this district is
concerned, they are inhabitants of the Pachaimalais and Kollaimalais.
The Malai&#257;lis of the two ranges will not intermarry, but have no
objection to dining together. For purposes of the caste discipline, the
villages of both sub-divisions are grouped into n&#257;dus. Each
n&#257;du contains some twenty or thirty villages. Each village has a
headman called on the Pachaimalais M&#363;ppan, and on the Kollaimalais
Ur-Kavundan or Kutti-M&#257;niyam. Again, on the Pachaimalais, every
five or ten villages make up a sittambalam, over which is a Kavundan,
and each n&#257;du is ruled by a Periya Kavundan. In the Kollaimalais
there are no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>sittambalams, but the n&#257;du there is also
presided over by a Periya Kavundan, who is sometimes called a S&#257;di
Kavundan. Again, on the Kollaimalais, the first four n&#257;dus are
grouped into one pattam under the Pattak&#257;ran of Valapp&#363;r, and
the other three into another under the Pattak&#257;ran of Sakkiratti.
The n&#257;du headmen on the Pachaimalais also do duty as
Pattak&#257;rans. All these appointments are hereditary. The permission
of the Pattak&#257;ran has to be obtained before a marriage can take
place, but, on the Kollaimalais, he deputes this power to the S&#257;di
Kavundan. The Pattak&#257;rans of both ranges have recognised
privileges, such as the right to ride on horseback, and use umbrellas,
which are denied to the common folk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Malaiy&#257;lis recognise the sanctity of the large
Vishnu temple at Sr&#299;rangam, and of the Siva temple at
Anapl&#275;svaran Kovil on the Kollaimalais. To the festival of the
latter in Adi (July-August) the Malaiy&#257;lis of all three divisions
flock. In every village is a temple or image of Perum&#257;l. Kali is
also commonly worshipped, but the Malaiy&#257;lis do not connect her
with Siva. Almost every village further contains temples to
M&#257;riyayi, the goddess of cholera, and to the village goddess
Pid&#257;ri. On the Kollaimalais, K&#257;li is also looked upon as a
village goddess, but she has no attendant Karuppans, nor is she
worshipped by shedding blood. Pid&#257;ri is often called Manu
Pid&#257;ri on the Pachaimalais, and is represented by a heap of mud.
At midnight, a sheep and some cooked rice are taken to this, a man
cleaning the pathway to the temple by dragging a bunch of leaves. The
sheep is killed, and its lungs are inflated and placed on the heap. On
the Kollaimalais two other goddesses, N&#257;chi and Kongalayi, are
commonly worshipped. At the worship of the former, perfect silence must
be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432</a>]</span>observed, and women are not allowed to be in the
village at the time. It is supposed that, if anyone speaks during the
ceremony, he will be stung by bees or other insects. The goddess has no
image, but is supposed to appear from the surface of the ground, and to
glitter like the comb of a cock. Kongalayi has an image, and her
worship is accompanied by music. All these goddesses are worshipped
every year before the ground is cultivated. The Malaiy&#257;lis, like
the people of the plains, worship Pattavans. But, on the Kollaimalais,
instead of thinking that these are people who have died a violent
death, they say they are virtuous men and good sportsmen, who have
lived to a ripe old age. The test of the apotheosis of such a one is
that his castemen should have a successful day&rsquo;s sport on some
day that they have set aside in his honour. They sometimes offer
regular sacrifices to the Pattavans, but more usually offer the head of
any game they shoot. Sometimes a man will dream of some evil spirit
turning Pattavan, and then he is taken to a <i>Strychnos Nux-vomica</i>
tree, and his hair nailed to the trunk and cut. This is supposed to
free the caste from further molestation. The same practice is observed
on the Pachaimalais, if the ghost appears in a dream accompanied by a
Panchama. On the Kollaimalais, holy bulls, dedicated to the
Sr&#299;rangam temple, are taken round with drums on their backs by men
with feathers stuck in their hair, and alms are collected. When these
animals die, they are buried, and an alari tree is planted over the
grave. This practice is, however, confined to Vaishnavites, and to a
few families. Saivites set free bulls called poli yerudu in honour of
the Anapl&#275;svaram god. These bulls are of good class, and, like the
tamatams, are honoured at their death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb433" href="#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Malaiy&#257;li houses are built of tattis (mats) of split
bamboo, and roofed with jungle grass. The use of tiles or bricks is
believed to excite the anger of the gods. The Kollaimalai houses seem
always to have a loft inside, approached by a ladder. The eaves project
greatly, so as almost to touch the ground. In the pial (platform at the
entrance) a hole is made to pen fowls in. On the tops of the houses,
tufts of jungle grass and rags are placed, to keep off owls, the
ill-omened k&#333;ttan birds. The villages are surrounded with a fence,
to keep the village pigs from destroying the crops outside. The
Pachaimalai women wear the kusavam fold in their cloth on the right
side, but do not cover the breasts. The Kollaimalai women do not wear
any kusavam, but carefully cover their breasts, especially when at work
outside the village site, for fear of displeasing the gods. The
Pachaimalai people tattoo, but this custom is anathema on the
Kollaimalais, where the Malaiy&#257;lis will not allow a tattooed
person into their houses for fear of offending their gods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Malaiy&#257;lis are keen sportsmen, and complain that
sport is spoilt by the forest rules. The Kollaimalai people have a
great beat on the first of Ani (June-July), and another on the day of
the first sowing of the year. The date of the latter is settled by the
headman of each village, and he alone is allowed to sow seeds on that
day, everyone else being debarred on pain of punishment from doing any
manner of work, and going out to hunt instead. On the Kollaimalais,
bull-baiting is practiced at the time of the M&#257;riyayi festival in
M&#257;si (February-March). A number of bulls are taken in front of the
goddess, one after the other, and, while some of the crowd hold the
animals with ropes, a man in front, and another behind, urge it on to
unavailing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>efforts to get free. When one bull is tired out,
another is brought up to take its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Malaiy&#257;lis have a good many superstitions of their
own, which are apparently different from those of the plains. If they
want rain, they pelt each other with balls of cow-dung, an image of
Pillaiyar (Gan&#275;sa) is buried in a manure pit, and a pig is killed
with a kind of spear. When the rain comes, the Pillaiyar is dug up. If
a man suffers from hemicrania, he sets free a red cock in honour of the
sun on a Tuesday. A man who grinds his teeth in his sleep may be broken
off the habit by eating some of the food offered to the village
goddess, brought by stealth from her altar. People suffering from
small-pox are taken down to the plains, and left in some village.
Cholera patients are abandoned, and left to die. Lepers are driven out
without the slightest mercy, to shift for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to marriage, the Malaiy&#257;lis of the
Trichinopoly district recognise the desirability of a boy&rsquo;s
marrying his maternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. This sometimes results in
a young boy marrying a grown-up woman, but the Malaiy&#257;lis in this
district declare that the boy&rsquo;s father does not then take over
the duties of a husband. On the Kollaimalais, a wife may leave her
husband for a paramour within the caste, but her husband has a right to
the children of such intercourse, and they generally go to him in the
end. You may ask a man, without giving offence, if he has lent his wife
to anyone. Both sections practice polygamy. A betrothal on the
Pachaimalais is effected by the boy&rsquo;s taking an oil bath,
followed by a bath in hot water at the bride&rsquo;s house, and
watching whether there is any ill omen during the process. On the
Kollaimalais, the matter is settled by a simple interview. On both hill
ranges, the wedding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435"
name="pb435">435</a>]</span>ceremonies last only one day, and on the
Pachaimalais a Thursday is generally selected. The marriage on the
latter range consists in all the relatives present dropping castor-oil
on to the heads of the pair with a wisp of grass, and then pronouncing
a blessing on them. The terms of the blessing are the same as those
used by the Konga Vell&#257;las. The bridegroom ties the t&#257;li. On
the Kollaimalais, the girl is formally invited to come and be married
by the other party&rsquo;s taking her a sheep and some rice. On the
appointed day, offerings of a cock and a hen are made to the gods in
the houses of both. The girl then comes to the other house, and she and
the bridegroom are garlanded by the leading persons present. The
bridegroom ties the t&#257;li, and the couple are then made to walk
seven steps, and are blessed. The garlands are then thrown into a well,
and, if they float together, it is an omen that the two will love each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both sections bury their dead. On the Kollaimalais, a gun is
fired when the corpse is taken out for burial, and tobacco, cigars,
betel and nut, etc., are buried with the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two curious customs in connection with labour are recognised
on both ranges. If a man has a press of work, he can compel the whole
village to come and help him, by the simple method of inviting them all
to a feast. He need not pay them for their services. A different custom
is that, when there is threshing to be done, any labourer of the caste
who offers himself has to be taken, whether there is work for him or
not, and paid as if he had done a good day&rsquo;s work. This is a very
hard rule in times of scarcity, and it is said that sometimes the
employer will have not only to pay out the whole of the harvest, but
will also have to get something extra from home to satisfy the
labourers.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436"
name="pb436">436</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Garstin<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5723src" href=
"#xd21e5723" name="xd21e5723src">46</a> that &ldquo;in his time (1878)
the Malai&#257;lis of the South Arcot district kept the accounts of
their payments of revenue by tying knots in a bit of string, and that
some of them once lodged a complaint against their village headman for
collecting more from them than was due, basing their case on the fact
that there were more knots in the current year&rsquo;s string than in
that of the year preceding. The poligars, he adds, used to intimate the
amount of revenue due by sending each of the cultivators a leaf bearing
on it as many thumb-nail marks as there were rupees to be
paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Malay&#257;li.</b>&mdash;A territorial name, denoting an
inhabitant of the Malay&#257;lam country. It is noted, in the Mysore
Census Report, 1901, that this name came in very handy to class several
of the Malabar tribes, who have immigrated to the province, and whose
names were unfamiliar to census officials. There is, in the city of
Madras, a Malay&#257;li club for inhabitants of the Malay&#257;lam
country, who are there employed in Government services, as lawyers, or
in other vocations. I read that, in 1906, the Malabar &#332;nam
festival was celebrated at the Victoria Public Hall under the auspices
of this club, and a dramatised version of the Malay&#257;lam novel
Indulekha was performed.</p>
<p><b>Malayan.</b>&mdash;Concerning the Malayans, Mr. A. R.
Loftus-Tottenham writes as follows. &ldquo;The Malayans are a
makkath&#257;yam caste, observing twelve days&rsquo; pollution, found
in North Malabar. Their name, signifying hill-men, points to their
having been at one time a jungle tribe, but they have by no means the
dark complexion and debased physiognomy characteristic of the classes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>which still occupy that position. They are
divided into nine exogamous illams, five of which have the names
K&#333;tukudi, Velup&#257;, Ch&#275;ni, Pal&#257;nkudi, and Kalliath.
The men do not shave their heads, but allow the hair to grow long, and
either part it in the middle, or tie it into a knot behind, like the
castes of the east coast, or tie it in a knot in front in the genuine
Malay&#257;li fashion. The principal occupation of the caste is
exorcism, which they perform by various methods.</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;If any one is considered to be possessed by demons, it is
usual, after consulting the astrologer in order to ascertain what murti
(form, <i>i.e.</i>, demon) is causing the trouble, to call in the
Malayan, who performs a ceremony known as t&#299;yattam, in which they
wear masks, and, so disguised, sing, dance, tom-tom, and play on a rude
and strident pipe. Another ceremony, known as ucchav&#275;li, has
several forms, all of which seem to be either survivals, or at least
imitations of human sacrifice. One of these consists of a mock living
burial of the principal performer, who is placed in a pit, which is
covered with planks, on the top of which a sacrifice is performed, with
a fire kindled with jack wood (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>) and a
plant called erinna. In another variety, the Malayan cuts his left
forearm, and smears his face with the blood thus drawn. Malayans also
take part with Peruvann&#257;ns (big barbers) in various ceremonies at
Badrak&#257;li and other temples, in which the performer impersonates,
in suitable costume, some of the minor deities or demons, fowls are
sacrificed, and a Velicchap&#257;d pronounces oracular
statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the profession of exorcists does not keep the Malayans fully
occupied, they go about begging during the harvest season, in various
disguises, of which that of a hobby-horse is a very common one. They
further <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>add to their income by singing songs, at which
they are very expert. Like the Nalkes and Paravas of South Canara, the
Malayans exorcise various kinds of devils, with appropriate disguises.
For Nenaveli (bloody sacrifice), the performer smears the upper part of
his body and face with a paste made of rice-flour reddened with
turmeric powder and chunam (lime) to indicate a bloody sacrifice.
Before the paste dries, parched paddy (unhusked rice) grains,
representing small-pox pustules, are sprinkled over it. Strips of young
cocoanut leaves, strung together so as to form a petticoat, are tied
round the waist, a ball of sacred ashes (vibh&#363;thi) is fixed on the
tip of the nose, and two strips of palmyra palm leaf are stuck in the
mouth to represent fangs. If it is thought that a human sacrifice is
necessary to propitiate the devil, the man representing Nenaveli puts
round his neck a kind of framework made of plantain leaf sheaths; and,
after he has danced with it on, it is removed, and placed on the ground
in front of him. A number of lighted wicks are stuck in the middle of
the framework, which is sprinkled with the blood of a fowl, and then
beaten and crushed. Sometimes this is not regarded as sufficient, and
the performer is made to lie down in a pit, which is covered over by a
plank, and a fire kindled. A Malayan, who acted the part of Nenaveli
before me at Tellicherry, danced and gesticulated wildly, while a small
boy, concealed behind him, sang songs in praise of the demon whom he
represented, to the accompaniment of a drum. At the end of the
performance, he feigned extreme exhaustion, and laid on the ground in a
state of apparent collapse, while he was drenched with water brought in
pots from a neighbouring well.</p>
<p>The disguise of Uchchaveli is also assumed for the propitiation of
the demon, when a human sacrifice is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb439" href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span>considered necessary.
The Malayan who is to take the part puts on a cap made of strips of
cocoanut leaf, and strips of the same leaves tied to a bent bamboo
stick round his waist. His face and chest are daubed with yellow paint,
and designs are drawn thereon in red or black. Strings are tied tightly
round the left arm near the elbow and wrist, and the swollen area is
pierced with a knife. The blood spouts out, and the performer waves the
arm, so that his face is covered with the blood. A fowl is waved before
him, and decapitated. He puts the neck in his mouth, and sucks the
blood.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Malayan devil-dancer with fowl in mouth.</p>
</div>
<p>The disguises are generally assumed at night. The exorcism consists
in drawing complicated designs of squares, circles, and triangles, on
the ground with white, black, and yellow flour. While the man who has
assumed the disguise dances about to the accompaniment of drums, songs
are sung by Malayan men and women.</p>

<p><b>Mal&#275;ru.</b>&mdash;It is noted, in the Mysore Census Report,
1901, that &ldquo;in some temples of the Maln&#257;d there exists a set
of females, who, though not belonging to the Natuva class, are yet
temple servants like them, and are known by the name of Mal&#275;ru.
Any woman who eats the sacrificial rice strewn on the balip&#299;tam
(sacrificial altar) at once loses caste, and becomes a public woman, or
Mal&#275;ru.&rdquo; The children of Mal&#275;rus by Br&#257;hmans are
termed Golakas. Any Mal&#275;ru woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

St&#257;nikas. They are attached to temples, and their ranks are
swelled by outcaste Br&#257;hman and Konkani women.</p>
<p><b>Maleyava.</b>&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
as a small Canarese-speaking caste of beggars. In the South Canara
Manual, it is stated that they are &ldquo;classed as mendicants, as
there is a small body of Malay&#257;lam gypsies of that name. But there

servants wear the sacred thread, and employ Br&#257;hmans as priests.
It is further recorded, in the Census Report, 1871, that &ldquo;the
M&#257;lis are, as their name denotes, gardeners. They chose for their
settlements sites where they were able to turn a stream to irrigate a

vegetables, which they carry to the numerous markets throughout the
country. Their rights to the lands acquired from the Parj&#257;s

perhaps a row of upright <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href=

<p class="figureHead">Malayan devil-dancers.</p>
</div>
<p>For the following note, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. The
M&#257;lis say that their ancestors lived originally at K&#257;si
(Benares), whence they emigrated to serve under the R&#257;ja of
Jeypore. They are divided into the following sub-divisions:&mdash;Bodo,
Pondra, Kosalya, Pannara, Sonkuva, and Dongrudiya. The name Pondra is
said to be derived from podoro, a dry field. I am informed that, if a
Pondra is so prosperous as to possess a garden which requires the
employment of a picottah, he is bound to entertain as many men of his
caste as choose to go to his house. A man without a picottah may refuse
to receive such visits. A picottah is the old-fashioned form of a
machine still used for raising water, and consists of a long lever or
yard pivotted on an upright post, weighted on the short arm, and
bearing a line and bucket on the long arm.</p>
<p>Among the Bodo M&#257;lis, a man can claim his paternal aunt&rsquo;s
daughter in marriage, which takes place before the girl reaches
puberty. A jholla tonka (bride-price) of forty rupees is paid, and the
girl is conducted to the house of the bridegroom, in front of which a
pandal (booth) has been erected, with nine pots, one above the other,
placed at the four corners and in the centre. In the middle of the
pandal a mattress is spread, and to the pandal a cloth, with a
myrabolam (<i>Terminalia</i> fruit), rice, and money tied up in it, is
attached. The contracting couple sit together, and a sacred thread is
given to the bridegroom by the officiating priest. The bride is
presented with necklaces, nose-screws, and other ornaments by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party. They then repair to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
house. The ceremonies are repeated during the next three days, and on
the fifth day <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>the pair are bathed with turmeric water, and
repair to a stream, in which they bathe. On their return home, the
bridegroom is presented with some cheap jewelry.</p>
<p>Among the Pondra M&#257;lis, if a girl is not provided with a
husband before she reaches puberty, a mock marriage is performed. A
pandal (booth) is erected in front of her house, and she enters it,
carrying a fan in her right hand, and sits on a mattress. A pot,
containing water and mango leaves, is set in front of her, and the
females throw turmeric-rice over her. They then mix turmeric powder
with castor-oil, and pour it over her from mango leaves. She next goes
to the village stream, and bathes. A caste feast follows after this
ceremonial has been performed. The girl is permitted to marry in the
ordinary way. A Bodo M&#257;li girl, who does not secure a husband
before she reaches puberty, is said to be turned out of the caste.</p>
<p>In the regular marriage ceremony among the Pondra M&#257;lis, the
bridegroom, accompanied by his party, proceeds to the bride&rsquo;s
village, where they stay in a house other than that of the bride. They
send five rupees, a new cloth for the bride&rsquo;s mother, rice, and
other things necessary for a meal, as jholla tonka (present) to the
bride&rsquo;s house. Pandals, made of four poles, are erected in front
of the houses of the bride and bridegroom. Towards evening, the
bridegroom proceeds to the house of the bride, and the couple are
blessed by the assembled relations within the pandal. On the following
day, the bridegroom conducts the bride to her pandal. They take their
seat therein, separated by a screen, with the ends of their cloths tied
together. Ornaments, called maguta, corresponding to the b&#257;shinga,
are tied on their foreheads. At the auspicious moment fixed by the
presiding D&#275;s&#257;ri, the bride stretches out her <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>right hand, and the bridegroom places his
thereon. On it some rice and myrabolam fruit are laid, and tied up with
rolls of cotton thread by the D&#275;s&#257;ri. On the third day, the
couple repair to a stream, and bathe. They then bury the magutas. After
a feast, the bride accompanies the bridegroom to his village, but, if
she has not reached puberty, returns to her parents.</p>
<p>Widow remarriage is permitted, and a younger brother usually marries
the widow of his elder brother.</p>
<p>The dead are burnt, and death pollution lasts for ten days, during
which those who are polluted refrain from their usual employment. On
the ninth day, a hole is dug in the house of the deceased, and a lamp
placed in it. The son, or some other close relative, eats a meal by the
side of the hole, and, when it is finished, places the platter and the
remains of the food in the hole, and buries them with the lamp. On the
tenth day, an Oriya Br&#257;hman purifies the house by raising the
sacred fire (h&#333;mam). He is, in return for his services, presented
with the utensils of the deceased, half a rupee, rice, and other
things.</p>

<p><b>Mand&#257;dan Chetti.</b>&mdash;There are at Gudal&#363;r near
the boundary between the N&#299;lgiri district and Malabar, and in the
Wyn&#257;d, two classes called respectively Mand&#257;dan Chettis and
Wyn&#257;d Chettis (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>
<p>The following account of the Mand&#257;dan Chettis is given in the
Gazetteer of the N&#299;lgiris. &ldquo;They speak a corrupt Canarese,
follow the makkat&#257;yam law of inheritance (from father to son), and
seem always to have been natives of the Wynaad. Mand&#257;dan is
supposed to be a corruption of Mah&#257;valin&#257;du, the traditional
name still applied to the country between Nellak&#333;ttai and
Tippak&#257;du, in which these Chettis principally reside. These
Chettis recognise as many as eight different headmen, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name="pb445">445</a>]</span>who
each have names and a definite order of precedence, the latter being
accurately marked by the varying lengths of the periods of pollution
observed when they die. They are supposed to be the descendants in the
nearest direct line of the original ancestors of the caste, and they
are shown special respect on public occasions, and settle domestic and
caste disputes. Marriages take place after puberty, and are arranged
through go-betweens called Madhyastas. When matters have been set in
train, the contracting parties meet, and the boy&rsquo;s parents
measure out a certain quantity of paddy (unhusked rice), and present it
to the bride&rsquo;s people, while the Madhyastas formally solicit the
approval to the match of all the nearest relatives. The bride is bathed
and dressed in a new cloth, and the couple are then seated under a
pandal (booth). The priest of the Nambalak&#333;d temple comes with
flowers, blesses the t&#257;li, and hands it to the bridegroom, who
ties it round the bride&rsquo;s neck. Sometimes the young man is made
to work for the girl as Jacob did for Rachael, serving her father for a
period (generally of from one to four years), the length of which is
settled by a panch&#257;yat (council). In such cases, the father-in-law
pays the expenses of the wedding, and sets up the young couple with a
house and some land. Married women are not prohibited from conferring
favours on their husbands&rsquo; brothers, but adultery outside the
caste is severely dealt with. Adoption seems to be unknown. A widow may
remarry. If she weds her deceased husband&rsquo;s brother, the only
ceremony is a dinner, after which the happy pair are formally seated on
the same mat; but, if she marries any one else, a pandal and t&#257;li
are provided. Divorce is allowed to both parties, and divorc&eacute;es
may remarry. In their cases, however, the wedding rites are much
curtailed. The dead are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href=
"#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>usually burnt, but those who have
been killed by accidents or epidemics are buried. When any one is at
death&rsquo;s door, he or she is made to swallow a little water from a
vessel in which some rice and a gold coin have been placed. The body is
bathed and dressed in a new cloth, sometimes music is played and a gun
fired, and in all cases the deceased&rsquo;s family walk three times
round the pyre before it is fired by the chief mourner. When the period
of pollution is over, holy water is fetched from the Nambalak&#333;d
temple, and sprinkled all about the house. These Chettis are Saivites,
and worship B&#275;tar&#257;yasv&#257;mi of Nambalak&#333;d, the Airu
Billi of the Kurumbas, and one or two other minor gods, and certain
deified ancestors. These minor gods have no regular shrines, but huts
provided with platforms for them to sit upon, in which lamps are lit in
the evenings, are built for them in the fields and jungles. Chetti
women are often handsome. In the house they wear only a waist-cloth,
but they put on an upper cloth when they venture abroad. They distend
the lobes of their ears, and for the first few years after marriage
wear in them circular gold ornaments somewhat resembling those affected
by the N&#257;yar ladies. After that period they substitute a strip of
rolled-up palm leaf. They have an odd custom of wearing a big chignon
made up of plaits of their own hair cut off at intervals in their
girlhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>M&#257;ndiri.</b>&mdash;A sub-division of D&#333;mb.</p>
<p><b>Mandula.</b>&mdash;The Mandulas (medicine men) are a wandering
class, the members of which go about from village to village in the
Telugu country, selling drugs (mandu, medicine) and medicinal powders.
Some of their women act as midwives. Of these people an interesting
account is given by Bishop Whitehead,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5924src" href="#xd21e5924" name="xd21e5924src">48</a> who writes
as follows. &ldquo;We found an encampment of five or six dirty-looking
huts made of matting, each about five feet high, eight feet long and
six feet wide, belonging to a body of Mandalav&#257;ru, whose
head-quarters are at Masulipatam. They are medicine men by profession,
and thieves and beggars by choice. The headman showed us his stock of
medicines in a bag, and a quaint stock it was, consisting of a
miscellaneous collection of stones and pieces of wood, and the fruits
of trees. The stones are ground to powder, and mixed up as a medicine
with various ingredients. He had a piece of mica, a stone containing
iron, and another which contained some other metal. There was also a
peculiar wood used as an antidote against snake-bite, a piece being
torn off and eaten by the person bitten. One common treatment for
children is to give them tiles, ground to powder, to eat. In the
headman&rsquo;s hut was a picturesque-looking woman sitting up with an
infant three days old. It had an anklet, made of its mother&rsquo;s
hair, tied round the right ankle, to keep off the evil eye. The mother,
too, had a similar anklet round her own left ankle, which she put on
before her confinement. She asked for some castor-oil to smear over the
child. They had a good many donkeys, pigs, and fowls with them, and
made, they said, about a rupee <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448"
href="#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>a day by begging. Some time
ago, they all got drunk, and had a free fight, in which a woman got her
head cut open. The police went to enquire into the matter, but the
woman declared that she only fell against a bamboo by accident. The
whole tribe meet once a year, at Masulipatam, at the Sivar&#257;tri
festival, and then sacrifice pigs and goats to their various deities.
The goddess is represented by a plain uncarved stone, about
four-and-a-half or five feet high, daubed with turmeric and kunkuma
(red powder). The animals are killed in front of the stone, and the
blood is allowed to flow on the ground. They believe that the goddess
drinks it. They cook rice on the spot, and present some of it to the
goddess. They then have a great feast of the rest of the rice and the
flesh of the victims, get very drunk with arrack, and end up with a
free fight. We noted that one of the men had on an anklet of hair, like
the woman&rsquo;s. He said he had been bitten by a snake some time ago,
and had put on the anklet as a charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mandula is a very imposing person, as he sits in a conspicuous
place, surrounded by paper packets piled up all round him. His method
of advertising his medicines is to take the packets one by one, and,
after opening them and folding them up, to make a fresh pile. As he
does so, he may be heard repeating very rapidly, in a sing-song tone,
&ldquo;Medicine for rheumatism,&rdquo; etc. Mandulas are sometimes to
be seen close to the Moore Market in the city of Madras, with their
heaps of packets containing powders of various colours.</p>
<p><b>Mangala.</b>&mdash;&ldquo;The Mangalas and Ambattans,&rdquo; Mr.
H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5935src" href=
"#xd21e5935" name="xd21e5935src">49</a> &ldquo;are the barber castes,
and are probably of identical origin, but, like the potters, they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name=
"pb449">449</a>]</span>have, by difference of locality, separated into
Telugus and Tamilians, who do not intermarry. Both are said to be the
offspring of a Br&#257;hman by a Vaisya woman. The Telugu name is
referred to the word mangalam, which means happiness and also
cleansing, and is applied to barbers, because they take part in
marriage ceremonies, and add to the happiness on the occasion by the
melodious sounds of their flutes (n&#257;gasaram), while they also
contribute to the cleanliness of the people by shaving their bodies.
The Telugus are divided into the Reddibh&#363;mi, Murikin&#257;du, and
Kurichin&#257;du sub-divisions, and are mostly Vaishnavites. They
consider the Tamilians as lower than themselves, because they consent
to shave the whole body, while the Telugus only shave the upper
portions. Besides their ordinary occupation, the members of this caste
pretend to some knowledge of surgery and of the properties of herbs and
drugs. Their females practice midwifery in a barbarous fashion, not
scrupling also to indulge largely in criminal acts connected with their
profession. Flesh-eating is allowed, but not widow marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mangalas,&rdquo; Mr. Stuart writes further,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5942src" href="#xd21e5942" name="xd21e5942src">50</a>
&ldquo;are also called Bajantri (in reference to their being
musicians), Kaly&#257;nakulam (marriage people), and Ang&#257;rakudu.
The word ang&#257;ramu means fire, charcoal, a live coal, and
ang&#257;rakudu is the planet Mars. Tuesday is Mars day, and one name
for it is Ang&#257;rakav&#257;ramu, but the other and more common name
is Mangalav&#257;ramu. Now mangala is a Sanskrit word, meaning
happiness, and mangala, with the soft l, is the Telugu for a barber.
Mangalav&#257;ramu and Ang&#257;rakav&#257;ramu being synonymous, it is
natural that the barbers should have seized upon this, and given
themselves importance by claiming to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450</a>]</span>the caste of the
planet Mars. As a matter of fact, this planet is considered to be a
star of ill omen, and Tuesday is regarded as an inauspicious day.
Barbers are also considered to be of ill omen owing to their connection
with deaths, when their services are required to shave the heads of the
mourners. On an auspicious occasion, a barber would never be called a
Mangala, but a Bajantri, or musician. Their titles are Anna and
G&#257;du.&rdquo; Anna means brother, and G&#257;du is a common suffix
to the names of Telugus, <i>e.g.</i>, R&#257;mig&#257;du,
Subbig&#257;du. A further title is Ayya (father).</p>
<p>For the following note on the Mangalas, I am indebted to Mr. C.
Hayavadana Rao. The caste is divided into two endogamous divisions,
Telaga and K&#257;pu, the ancestors of which were half brothers, by
different mothers. They will eat together, but will not intermarry, as
they regard themselves as cousins. The primary occupation of the caste
is shaving the heads of people belonging to the non-polluting castes,
and, for a small consideration, razors are lent to M&#257;digas and
M&#257;las. A Mangala, in the Vizagapatam district, carries no
pollution with him, when he is not actually engaged in his professional
duties, and may often be found as storekeeper in Hindu households, and
occupying the same position as the Bhond&#257;ri, or Oriya barber, does
in the Oriya country. Unlike the Tamil Ambattan, the Mangala has no
objection to shaving Europeans. He is one of the village officials,
whose duties are to render assistance to travellers, and massage their
limbs, and, in many villages, he is rewarded for his services with a
grant of land. He is further the village musician, and an expert at
playing on the flute. Boys are taught the art of shaving when they are
about eight years old. An old chatty (earthen pot) is turned upside
down, and smeared with damp earth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451"

(unhusked rice), tender leaves of the cocoanut, a mimic arrow, a metal
looking-glass, a well-washed cloth, burning fire, and a small round
wooden box called cheppu. M&#257;ngalyam occurs as the name for

<p><b>Mann&#257;diyar.</b>&mdash;A trading sub-division of
N&#257;yar.</p>
<p><b>Mann&#257;n.</b>&mdash;The Mann&#257;ns are a hill tribe of
Travancore, and are said to have been originally dependents of the
kings of Madura, whom they, like the &#362;r&#257;lis and Muduvans,
accompanied to N&#275;riyamangalam. &ldquo;Later on, they settled in a
portion of the Cardamom Hills called Makara-alum. One of the chiefs of
Poonyat nominated three of these Mann&#257;ns as his agents at three
different centres in his dominions, one to live at Toll&#257;iramalai
with a silver sword as badge and with the title of Varayilk&#299;zh
Mann&#257;n, a second to live at Mann&#257;nkantam with a bracelet and
the title of G&#333;pura Mann&#257;n, and a third at Utumpanch&#333;la
with a silver cane and the title of Talamala Mann&#257;n. For these
headmen, the other Mann&#257;ns are expected to do a lot of
miscellaneous services. It is only with the consent of the headmen that
marriages may be contracted. Persons of both sexes dress themselves
like Maravans. Silver and brass ear-rings are worn by the men. Necklets
of white and red beads are worn on the neck, and brass bracelets on the
wrist. Mann&#257;ns put up the best huts among the hill-men. Menstrual
and puerperal impurity is not so repelling as in the case of the
&#362;r&#257;lis. About a year after a child is born, the eldest member
of the family ties a necklet of beads round its neck, and gives it a
name. The Mann&#257;ns bury their dead. The coffin is made of bamboo
and reeds, and the corpse is taken to the grave with music and the
beating of drums. The personal ornaments, if any, are not removed.
Before filling in the grave, a quantity of rice is put into the mouth
of the deceased. A shed is erected over the site of burial. After a
year has passed, an offering of food and drink is made to the dead. The
language of the Mann&#257;ns is Tamil. They have neither washermen nor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>barbers, but wash clothes and shave for one
another. The Mann&#257;ns stand ahead of the other hill-men from their
knowledge of medicine, though they resort more to Ch&#257;ttu than to
herbs. Drinking is a very common vice. <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6002" title="Source: Marumakkathayam">Marumakkath&#257;yam</span>
is the prevailing form of inheritance (in the female line); but it is
customary to give a portion to the sons also. Marriage takes the form
of t&#257;li-tying. The t&#257;li (marriage badge) is removed on the
death of the husband. Women generally wait for two years to marry a
second husband, after the death of the first. A Mann&#257;n claims the
hand of his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter. The S&#257;sta of
Sabarimala and Periy&#257;r is devoutly worshipped. The Mann&#257;ns
are experts in collecting honey. They eat the flesh of the monkey, but
not that of the crocodile, snake, buffalo or cow. They are fast
decreasing in numbers, like the other denizens of the
hills.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6005src" href="#xd21e6005"
name="xd21e6005src">51</a></p>
<p>Concerning the Mann&#257;ns, Mr. O. H. Bensley writes as
follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6010src" href="#xd21e6010" name=
"xd21e6010src">52</a> &ldquo;I enjoy many pleasant reminiscences of my
intercourse with these people. Their cheery and sociable disposition,
and enjoyment of camp life, make it quite a pleasure to be thrown into
contact with them. Short, sturdy, and hairless, the Mann&#257;ns have
all the appearances of an &lsquo;aboriginal&lsquo; race. The
Mann&#257;n country extends southward from the limit occupied by the
Muduvans on the Cardamom Hills to a point south of the territory now
submerged by the Periy&#257;r works.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6013src" href="#xd21e6013" name="xd21e6013src">53</a> They have,
moreover, to keep to the east of the Periy&#257;r river. Smallpox
ravages their villages, and fever lives in the air they breathe. Within
the present generation, three of their settlements were at the point of
extinction, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>but were recruited from other more fortunate
bands. Very few attain to old age, but there were until lately three
old patriarchs among them, who were the headmen of three of the most
important sections of the tribe. The Muduvans and Mann&#257;ns pursue
the same destructive method of cultivation, but, as the latter are much
fewer in numbers, their depredations are not so serious. None of the
tribes east of the Periy&#257;r pay any tax to the Government, but are
expected, in return for their holdings, to perform certain services in
the way of building huts and clearing paths, for which they receive
fixed payment. They have also to collect forest produce, and for this,
too, they obtain fixed rates, so that their treatment by the Government
is in reality of the most liberal kind. Mann&#257;ns do not always look
at things in quite the light one would expect. For example, the heir to
an English Earldom, after a pleasant shooting trip in Travancore,
bestowed upon a Mann&#257;n who had been with him a handsome knife as a
memento. Next day, the knife was seen in the possession of a cooly on a
coffee estate, and it transpired that the Mann&#257;n had sold it to
him for three rupees, instead of keeping it as an heirloom. A
remarkable trait in the character of the Mann&#257;ns is the readiness
with which they fraternise with Europeans. Most of the other tribes
approach with reluctance, which requires considerable diplomacy to
overcome. Not so the Mann&#257;n. He willingly initiates a tyro and a
stranger into the mysteries of the chase. Though their language is
Tamil, and the only communication they hold with the low country is on
the Madura side, they have this custom in common with the
Malay&#257;lis, that the chieftainship of their villages goes to the
nephew, and not to the son. One does not expect to find heroic actions
among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455</a>]</span>these simple people. But how else could one
describe the following incident? A Mann&#257;n, walking with his son, a
lad about twelve years old, came suddenly upon a rogue elephant. His
first act was to place his son in a position of safety by lifting him
up till he could reach the branch of a tree, and only then he began to
think of himself. But it was too late. The elephant charged down upon
him, and in a few seconds he was a shapeless mass.&rdquo;</p>

"xd21e6055src" href="#xd21e6055" name="xd21e6055src">55</a> that
&ldquo;originally the descendants of Arab traders by the women of the
country, they now form a powerful community. There appears to have been
a large influx of Arab settlers into Malabar in the ninth century A.D.
and the numbers have been constantly increased by proselytism. The
M&#257;ppillas came prominently forward at the time of the Portuguese
invasion at the end of the fifteenth century A.D.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Muhammadan Arabs,&rdquo; Dr. Burnell writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6058src" href="#xd21e6058" name="xd21e6058src">56</a>
&ldquo;appear to have settled first in Malabar about the beginning of
the ninth century; there were heathen Arabs there long before that in
consequence of the immense trade conducted by the Sabeans with
India.&rdquo; &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; Mr. B. Govinda Nambiar
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6061src" href="#xd21e6061" name=
"xd21e6061src">57</a> &ldquo;many accounts extant in Malabar concerning
the introduction of the faith of Isl&#257;m into this district.
Tradition says that, in the ninth century of the Christian era, a party
of Moslem pilgrims, on their way to a sacred shrine in Ceylon, chanced
to visit the capital of the Perum&#257;l or king of Malabar, that they
were most hospitably entertained by that prince, and that he, becoming
a convert to their faith, subsequently accompanied them to Arabia
(where he died). It is further stated that the Perum&#257;l, becoming
anxious of establishing his new faith in Malabar, with suitable places
of worship, sent his followers with letters to all the chieftains whom
he had appointed in his stead, requiring <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb457" href="#pb457" name="pb457">457</a>]</span>them to give land for
mosques, and to endow them. The Perum&#257;l&rsquo;s instructions were
carried out, and nine mosques were founded and endowed in various parts
of Malabar. Whatever truth there may be in these accounts, it is
certain that, at a very early period, the Arabs had settled for
commercial purposes on the Malabar coast, had contracted alliances with
the women of the country, and that the mixed race thus formed had begun
to be known as the M&#257;ppillas. These M&#257;ppillas had, in the
days of the Zamorin, played an important part in the political history
of Malabar, and had in consequence obtained many valuable privileges.
When Vasco da Gama visited Calicut during the closing years of the
fifteenth century, we find their influence at court so powerful that
the Portuguese could not obtain a commercial footing there. The
numerical strength of the M&#257;ppillas was greatly increased by
forcible conversions during the period when Tippu Sultan held sway over
Malabar.&rdquo; [At the installation of the Zamorin, some M&#257;ppilla
families at Calicut have certain privileges; and a M&#257;ppilla woman,
belonging to a certain family, presents the Zamorin with betel nuts
near the Kallai bridge, on his return from a procession through the
town.] According to one version of the story of the Perum&#257;l,
Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l dreamt that the full moon appeared at
Mecca on the night of the new moon, and that, when on the meridian, it
split into two, one half remaining in the air, and the other half
descending to the foot of a hill called Abu Kubais, where the two
halves joined together. Shortly afterwards, a party of pilgrims, on
their way to the foot-print shrine at Adam&rsquo;s peak in Ceylon,
landed in Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l&rsquo;s capital at
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6067" title=

same miracle, Muhammad had converted a number of unbelievers to his
religion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=

<p>The cephalic index of the M&#257;ppillas is lower than that of the
other Muhammadan classes in South India which I have examined, and this
may probably be explained by their admixture with dolichocephalic
Dravidians. The figures are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>From the measurement of a very few M&#257;ppillas, members of the
Hyderabad Contingent, and Mar&#257;thas, who went to England for the
Coronation in 1902, Mr. J. Gray arrived at the conclusion that
&ldquo;the people on the west coast and in the centre of the Deccan,
namely the Moplas, Maharattas, and Hyderabad Contingent, differ
considerably from the Tamils of the east coast. Their heads are
considerably shorter. This points to admixture of the Dravidians with
some Mongolian element. There is a tradition that the Moplas are
descended from Arab traders, but the measurements indicate that the
immigrants were Turkish, or of some other Mongolian element, probably
from Persia or Baluchistan.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6128src"

<p>The number of individuals examined is, however, too small for the

<p>In the Census Report, 1891, it is noted that some M&#257;ppillas
have returned &ldquo;Putiya Isl&#257;m,&rdquo; meaning new converts to
Isl&#257;m. These are mostly converts from the Mukkuvan or fisherman
caste, and this process of conversion is still going on. Most of the
fishermen of Tan&#363;r, where there is an important fish-curing yard,
are Mukkuvan converts. They are sleek and well-nourished, and, to judge
from the swarm of children who followed me during my inspection of the
yard, eminently fertile. One of them, indeed, was polygynous to the
extent of seven wives, each of whom had presented him with seven sons,
not to mention a large consignment of daughters. On the east coast the
occurrence of twins is attributed by the fishermen to the stimulating
properties of fish diet. In Malabar, great virtue is attributed to the
sardine or nalla mathi (good fish, <i>Clupea longiceps</i>), as an
article of dietary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conversion to Muhammadanism,&rdquo; Mr. Logan
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6180src" href="#xd21e6180" name=
"xd21e6180src">59</a> &ldquo;has had a marked effect in freeing the
slave caste in Malabar from their former burthens. By conversion a
Cheruman obtains a distinct rise in the social scale, and, if he is in
consequence bullied or beaten, the influence of the whole Muhammadan
community comes to his aid.&rdquo; The same applies to the
Nay&#257;dis, of whom some have escaped from their degraded position by
conversion to Isl&#257;m. In the scale of pollution, the Nay&#257;di
holds the lowest place, and consequently labours under the greatest
disadvantage, which is removed with his change of religion.</p>
<p>As regards the origin and significance of the word M&#257;ppilla,
according to Mr. Lewis Moore, it means, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb460" href="#pb460" name="pb460">460</a>]</span>&rdquo;(1) a
bridegroom or son-in-law; (2) the name given to Muhammadan, Christian,
or Jewish colonists in Malabar, who have intermarried with the natives
of the country. The name is now confined to Muhammadans.&rdquo; It is
noted by Mr. Nelson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6187src" href=
"#xd21e6187" name="xd21e6187src">60</a> that &ldquo;the Kallans alone
of all the castes of Madura call the Muhammadans M&#257;ppilleis, or
bridegrooms.&rdquo; In criticising this statement, Yule and
Burnell<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6190src" href="#xd21e6190" name=
"xd21e6190src">61</a> state that &ldquo;Nelson interprets the word as
bridegroom. It should, however, rather be son-in-law. The husband of
the existing Princess of Tanjore is habitually styled by the natives
M&#257;ppillai Sahib, as the son-in-law of the late R&#257;ja.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; Mr. Padmanabha Menon writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6193src" href="#xd21e6193" name="xd21e6193src">62</a>
&ldquo;think that the word M&#257;ppila is a contracted form of
mah&#257; (great) and pilla (child), an honorary title as among Nairs
in Travancore (pilla or pillay). Mr. Logan surmises that mah&#257;
pilla was probably a title of honour conferred on the early
Muhammadans, or possibly on the still earlier Christian immigrants, who
are also down to the present day called M&#257;ppilas. The Muhammadans
generally go by the name of Jonaga M&#257;ppilas. Jonaka is believed to
stand for Yavanaka, <i>i.e</i>., Greek!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6200src" href="#xd21e6200" name="xd21e6200src">63</a> [In the
Gazetteer of the Tanjore district, Yavana is recorded as meaning
Ionia.] It is, indeed, remarkable that in the Payyanorep&#257;t,
perhaps the earliest Malay&#257;lam poem extant, some of the sailors
mentioned in it are called Chonavans. (The Jews are known as Juda
M&#257;ppila.) Dr. Day derives the word M&#257;pilla from M&#257;
(mother) and pilla (child). [Wilson gives M&#257;pilla, mother&rsquo;s
son, as being sprung from the intercourse of foreign colonists, who
were persons unknown, with Malabar women.] Duncan says <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href="#pb461" name="pb461">461</a>]</span>that
a Q&#257;zi derived the name from M&#257; (mother) and pilla a (puppy)
as a term of reproach! Maclean, in the Asiatic Researches, considered
that the word came from mah&#257; or mohai (mocha) and pilla (child),
and therefore translated it into children or natives (perhaps outcasts)
of Mohai or Mocha. A more likely, and perhaps more correct derivation
is given by Mr. Percy Badger in a note to his edition of the Varthema.
&ldquo;I am inclined to think,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that the name is
either a corruption of the Arabic muflih (from the root fallah, to till
the soil), meaning prosperous or victorious, in which sense it would
apply to the successful establishment of those foreign Mussalmans on
the western coast of India; or that it is a similar corruption of
maflih (the active participial form of the same verb), an
agriculturist&mdash;a still more appropriate designation of Moplahs,
who, according to Buchanan, are both traders and farmers. In the latter
sense, the term, though not usually so applied among the Arabs, would
be identical with fella&rsquo;h.&rdquo; By Mr. C. P. Brown the
conviction was expressed that M&#257;ppilla is a Tamil mispronunciation
of the Arabic mu&rsquo;abbar, from over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief characteristic of the M&#257;ppillas,&rdquo; Mr.
Govinda Nambiar writes, &ldquo;as of all Mussalmans, is enthusiasm for
religious practices. They are either Sunnis or Shiahs. The Sunnis are
the followers of the Ponn&#257;ni Tangal, the chief priest of the
orthodox party, while the Shiahs acknowledge the Kond&#333;tti Tangal
as their religious head. There are always religious disputes between
these sects, and the criminal courts are not seldom called in to settle
them.&rdquo; In an account of the M&#257;ppillas,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6209src" href="#xd21e6209" name="xd21e6209src">64</a> Mr. P.
Kunjain, a Mappilla Government official (the first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name=
"pb462">462</a>]</span>M&#257;ppilla Deputy Collector), states that
&ldquo;there are a few Moplahs in the Ern&#257;d and Waluwan&#257;d
t&#257;luks who are the followers of the Kond&#333;tti Tangal, and are,
therefore, believed to be heretics (Shias). The number of these is
dwindling. The reason why they are believed to be heretics, and as such
outcasted, is that they are enjoined by their preceptor (the Tangal) to
prostrate before him. Prostration (sujud), according to strict
doctrines, is due to God alone.&rdquo; At Mulliakurichi in the
Walluwan&#257;d t&#257;luk there are two mosques. One, the Pazhaya
Palli, or old mosque, belongs to, or is regarded as belonging to the
Kond&#333;tti sect of M&#257;ppillas. The other is called Puthan Palli,
or new mosque. This mosque is asserted by the Ponn&#257;ni sect of
M&#257;ppillas to have been erected for their exclusive use. The
Kond&#333;tti sect, on the other hand, claim that it was erected by
them, as the old mosque was not large enough for the growing
congregation. They do not claim exclusive use of the new mosque, but a
right to worship there, just like any other Muhammadan. The
Ponn&#257;ni sect, however, claim a right to exclude the Kond&#333;tti
people from the new mosque altogether. In September, 1901, there was a
riot at the mosque between members of the rival sects. The
M&#257;ppillas have a college at Ponn&#257;ni, the chief seat of their
religious organisation, where men are trained in religious offices.
This institution, called the Jammat mosque, was, it is said, founded in
the twelfth or thirteenth century A.D. by an Arab divine for the
purpose of imparting religious instruction to youths of the Muhammadan
community. The head of the institution selects the ablest and most
diligent from among the students, and confers on him the title of
Musaliar. He is then appointed to preach in mosques, and to explain the
meaning of the Kor&#257;n and other sacred writings. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463" name=
"pb463">463</a>]</span>There are other religious offices, as those of
the K&#257;zi, Katib, and Mulla. The highest personages of divinity
among them are known as Tangals. In the middle of the last century
there was a very influential Tangal (Mambram Tangal), who was suspected
of fomenting outbreaks, and who conferred his blessing on the murderous
projects of his disciples. Of him it is stated that he was regarded as
imbued with a portion of divinity, and that the M&#257;ppillas swore by
his foot as their most solemn oath. Earth on which he had spat or
walked was treasured up, and his blessing was supremely prized. Even
among the higher class of M&#257;ppillas, his wish was regarded as a
command.</p>
<p>Mr. A. R. Loftus-Tottenham informs me that &ldquo;it is quite common
now for M&#257;ppillas to invoke Mambram Tangal when in difficulties. I
have heard a little M&#257;ppilla, who was frightened at my appearance,
and ran away across a field, calling out &lsquo;Mambram Tangal, Mambram
Tangal.&rsquo; The Tangal, who had to be induced to leave Malabar, went
off to Constantinople, and gained great influence with the
Sultan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1822 it was recorded<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6220src" href=
"#xd21e6220" name="xd21e6220src">65</a> by Mr. Baber, in a circuit
report, that the Tarramal and Condotty Tangals &ldquo;pretend to an
extraordinary sanctity, and such is the character they have
established, that the people believe it is in their power to carry them
harmless through the most hazardous undertakings, and even to absolve
them of the most atrocious crimes. To propitiate them, their votaries
are lavish in their presents, and there are no description of
delinquents who do not find an asylum in the mosques wherein these
Tangals take up their abode, whether pursued by the Police, or by their
own evil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=
"pb464">464</a>]</span>consciences.&rdquo; There is a legend current on
the Kavarathi island of the Laccadives that a Tangal of that island
once cursed the crows for dropping their excrement on his person, and
now there is not a crow on the island. On another occasion, hearing the
cries of a woman in labour, the Tangal prayed to God that the women of
the island might suffer from no such pains in future. So strong is the
belief in the immunity from the pangs of child-birth which was thus
obtained, that the women of the neighbouring islands go over to
Kavarathi for delivery, in order to have an easy confinement.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6227src" href="#xd21e6227" name=
"xd21e6227src">66</a></p>
<p>In connection with M&#257;ppilla superstition, Mr. Tottenham writes
as follows. &ldquo;A beggar died (probably of starvation) by the
roadside in Walluvan&#257;d t&#257;luk. When alive, no one worried
about him. But, after he died, it was said that celestial voices had
been heard uttering the call to prayer at the spot. The M&#257;ppillas
decided that he was a very holy man, whom they had not fed during his
life, and who should be canonised after death. A little tomb was
erected, and a light may be seen burning there at night. Small banners
are deposited by the faithful, who go in numbers to the place, and
there is, I think, a money-box to receive their contributions.&rdquo;
Mr. Tottenham writes further that &ldquo;the holy place at Malappuram
is the tomb of the S&#257;yyids (saints or martyrs) who were killed in
a battle by a local military chieftain. These S&#257;yyids are invoked.
At Kondotti there is a very pretentious, and rather picturesque
tomb&mdash;a square building of gneiss surmounted by a cupola&mdash;to
one of the Tangals. Near it is a small tank full of more or less tame
fish. It is one of the sights of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb465" href="#pb465" name="pb465">465</a>]</span>place to see them
fed. At the great festival called neercha (vow), the M&#257;ppillas go
in procession, headed by banners, elephants (if they possess them), and
music, and carrying offerings to the head-quarters (Malappuram and
Kondotti are the principal ones) of some Tangal, where they deposit the
banners, I think at the tomb of the local saint, and present the
offerings to the Tangal. At Malappuram, an enormous crowd of ten to
twenty thousand assembles, and there is a great tam&#257;sha (popular
excitement). You will sometimes see a man with his hair uncut,
<i>i.e.</i>, he does not cut it till he has fulfilled the
vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a tradition that, some centuries ago, one Sheik Mahomed
Tangal died. One night, some M&#257;ppillas dreamt that his grave,
which was near the reefs, was in danger of being washed away, and that
they should remove the body to a safe place. They accordingly opened
the grave, and found the body quite fresh, with no sign of
decomposition. The remains were piously re-interred in another place,
and a mosque, known as Sheikkinde Palli, built. The M&#257;ppillas of
Calicut celebrate annually, on the 15th day of Rajub, the anniversary
of the death of Sheik Mahomed Tangal, the date of which was made known
through inspiration by an ancestor of the Mambram Tangal. The ancestor
also presented the Mullah of the mosque with a head-dress, which is
still worn by successive Mullahs on the occasion of the anniversary
festival. &ldquo;The festival goes by the name of Appani (trade in
bread). A feature of the celebration is that every Moplah household
prepares a supply of rice cakes, which are sent to the mosque to be
distributed among the thousands of beggars who gather for the occasion.
A very brisk trade is also carried on in these rice cakes, which are
largely bought by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href=
"#pb466" name="pb466">466</a>]</span>charitable for distribution among
the poor. On the day of the anniversary, as well as on the day
following, prayers are offered up to the souls of the departed.
According to a legend, the pious Sheik, during his travels in foreign
lands, arrived at Achin disguised as a fakir. One day, some servants of
the local Sultan came to him, recognising in him a holy man, and begged
his help in a serious difficulty. Their Sultan, they said, had a
favourite parrot which used to be kept in a golden cage, and, the door
of this cage having been inadvertently left open, the parrot had
escaped. On hearing of the loss of his favourite bird, the Sultan had
threatened his ministers and servants with dire punishment, if they
failed to recover the bird. Sheik Mahomed Koya directed the servants to
place the cage in the branches of a neighbouring tree, assuring them
that the parrot would come and enter his cage. Saying this, the holy
man departed. The servants did as he had bidden them, and had the
gratification of seeing the bird fly into the cage, and of recovering
and conveying it to their master. The Sultan asked the bird why it went
away when it had a beautiful golden cage to live in, and a never
failing supply of dainty food to subsist upon. The parrot replied that
the beautiful cage and the dainty food were not to be compared with the
delights of a free and unfettered life spent under the foliage of
feathery bamboos, swayed by gentle breezes. The Sultan then asked the
bird why it had come back, and the bird made answer that, while it was
disporting itself with others of its species in a clump of bamboos, a
stifling heat arose, which it feared would burn its wings, but, as it
noticed that on one side of the clump the atmosphere was cool, it flew
to that spot to take shelter on a tree. Seeing the cage amidst the
branches, it entered, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href=
"#pb467" name="pb467">467</a>]</span>and was thus recaptured and
brought back. The Sultan afterwards discovered that it was the fakir
who had thus miraculously brought about the recovery of his bird, and
further that the fakir was none other than the saintly Sheik Mahomed
Koya Tangal. When the news of the Tangal&rsquo;s death was subsequently
received, the Sultan ordered that the anniversary of the day should be
celebrated in his dominions, and the Moplahs of Calicut believe that
the faithful in Achin join with them every year in doing honour to the
memory of their departed worthy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6244src" href="#xd21e6244" name="xd21e6244src">67</a></p>
<p>It is recorded, in the Annual Report of the Basel Medical Mission,
Calicut, 1907, that &ldquo;cholera and smallpox were raging terribly in
the months of August and September. It is regrettable that the people,
during such epidemics, do not resort to hospital medicines, but ascribe
them to the devil&rsquo;s scourge. Especially the ignorant and
superstitious Moplahs believe that cholera is due to demoniac
possession, and can only be cured by exorcism. An account of how this
is done may be interesting. A Thangal (Moplah priest) is brought in
procession, with much shouting and drumming, to the house to drive out
the cholera devil. The Thangal enters the house, where three cholera
patients are lying; two of these already in a collapsed condition. The
wonder-working priest refuses to do anything with these advanced cases,
as they seem to be hopeless. The other patient, who is in the early
stage of the disease, is addressed as follows. &lsquo;Who are
you?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I am the cholera devil&rsquo;. &lsquo;Where do
you come from?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;From such and such a place&rsquo;.
&lsquo;Will you clear out at once or not?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No, I
won&rsquo;t&rsquo;. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Because I want
something to quench my thirst&rsquo;. &lsquo;You <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb468" href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>want
blood?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;. Then the Thangal asks his
followers and relatives to give him what he asks. A young bull is
brought into the room and killed on the spot, and the patient is made
to drink the warm blood. Then the Thangal commands him to leave the
place at once. The patient, weak and exhausted, gathers up all his
strength, and runs out of the house, aided by a cane which is freely
applied to his back. He runs as far as he can, and drops exhausted on
the road. Then he is carried back, and, marvellous to say, he makes a
good recovery.&rdquo;</p>

predecessors belong to a different line.] In the Mahadun there was a
sect of religious head for the M&#257;ppilas from Kodangalur to
Mangalore. His office was, and is still held in the greatest
veneration. His decrees were believed to be infallible. (His decrees
are accepted as final.) The Zamorins recognised the Mahadunship, as is
seen from the presentation of the office dress at every succession. In
the famous Jamath mosque they (the Mahaduns) have been giving
instruction in Kor&#257;n ever since they established themselves at
Ponn&#257;ni. Students come here from different parts of the country.
After a certain standard of efficiency, the degree of Musaliar is
conferred upon the deserving Mullas (their name in their undergraduate
course). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>This ceremony consists simply in the sanction
given by the Mahadun to read at the big lamp in the mosque, where he
sometimes gives the instruction personally. The ceremony is known as
vilakkath irikka (to sit by the lamp). When the degree of Musaliar is
conferred, this sacred lamp is lit, and the Mahadun is present with a
number of Musaliars. These Musaliars are distributed through the length
and breadth of the land. They act as interpreters of the Kor&#257;n,
and are often appointed in charge of the mosques. When I visited the
Jamath, there were about three hundred students. There is no regular
staff of teachers. Students are told off into sections under the
management of some senior students. The students are confined to the
mosque for their lodgings, while most of them enjoy free boarding from
some generous M&#257;ppilla or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am informed by Mr. Kunjain that &ldquo;Mulla ordinarily means a
man who follows the profession of teaching the Kor&#257;n to children,
reading it, and performing petty religious ceremonies for others, and
lives on the scanty perquisites derived therefrom. The man in charge of
a mosque, and who performs all petty offices therein, is also called a
Mulla.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6263src" href="#xd21e6263" name=
"xd21e6263src">69</a> This name is, however, peculiar to South Malabar.
At Quilandi and around it the teacher of the Kor&#257;n is called
Muallimy, at Badagara Moiliar (Musaliar), at Kottayam Seedi, at
Cannanore Kalfa, and north of it Mukri. The man in charge of a mosque
is also called Mukir in North Malabar, while in South Malabar Mukir is
applied to the man who digs graves, lights lamps, and supplies water to
the mosque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mosques of the M&#257;ppillas are quite unlike those of any
other Muhammadans. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Mr. Fawcett <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470</a>]</span>writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6270src"
href="#xd21e6270" name="xd21e6270src">70</a> &ldquo;one sees no
minarets. The temple architecture of Malabar was noticed by Mr.
Fergusson to be like that of Nep&#257;l: nothing like it exists between
the two places. And the M&#257;ppilla mosque is much in the style of
the Hindu temple, even to the adoption of the turret-like edifice
which, among Hindus, is here peculiar to the temples of Siva. The
general use nowadays of German mission-made tiles is bringing about,
alas! a metamorphosis in the architecture of Hindu temples and
M&#257;ppilla mosques, the picturesqueness disappearing altogether, and
in a few years it may be difficult to find one of the old style. The
mosque, though it may be little better than a hovel, is always as grand
as the community can make it, and once built it can never be removed,
for the site is sacred ever afterwards. Every M&#257;ppilla would shed
his blood, rather than suffer any indignity to a mosque.&rdquo; The
mosques often consist of &ldquo;several stories, having two or more
roofs, one or more of the upper stories being usually built of wood,
the sides sloping inwards at the bottom. The roof is pent and tiled.
There is a gable end at one (the eastern) extremity, the timber on this
being often elaborately carved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One section of M&#257;ppillas at Calicut is known as &ldquo;Clap the
hand&rdquo; (Keikottakar) in contradistinction to another section,
which may not clap hands (Keikott&#257;ttakar). On the occasion of
wedding and other ceremonies, the former enjoy the privilege of
clapping their hands as an accompaniment to the processional music,
while the latter are not permitted to do so.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6275src" href="#xd21e6275" name="xd21e6275src">71</a> It is said
that at one time the differences of opinion between the two sections
ran so high that the question was referred <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name="pb471">471</a>]</span>for
decision to the highest ecclesiastical authorities at Mecca.</p>
<p>The M&#257;ppillas observe the Ramaz&#257;n, Bakrid, and Haj.
&ldquo;They only observe the ninth and tenth days of Muharam, and keep
them as a fast; they do not make taboots.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6284src" href="#xd21e6284" name="xd21e6284src">72</a> A common
religious observance is the celebration of what is called a mavulad or
maulad. A maulad is a tract or short treatise in Arabic celebrating the
birth, life, works and sayings of the prophet, or some saint such as
Shaik Mohiuddin, eleventh descendant of the prophet, expounder of the
Kor&#257;n, and worker of miracles, or the Mambram Tangal, father of
Sayid Fasl. For the ceremony a Mulla is called in to read the book,
parts of which are in verse, and the congregation is required to make
responses, and join in the singing. The ceremony, which usually takes
place in the evening, concludes with, or is preceded by a feast, to
which the friends and relations are invited. Those who can afford it
should perform a maulad in honour of Shaik Mohiuddin on the eleventh of
every month, and one in honour of the prophet on the twelfth. A maulad
should also be performed on the third day after death. It is also a
common practice to celebrate a maulad before any important undertaking
on which it is desired to invoke a blessing, or in fulfilment of some
vows; hence the custom of maulads preceding outbreaks.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>For a detailed account of the fanatical<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6292src" href="#xd21e6292" name="xd21e6292src">74</a> outbreaks
in the M&#257;ppilla community, which have long disturbed the peace of
Malabar from time to time, I must refer the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472" name=

From these sources, and from the class handbook (M&#257;ppillas) for
the Indian Army,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6297src" href="#xd21e6297"
name="xd21e6297src">75</a> the following note relating to some of the
more serious of the numerous outbreaks has been compiled.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6300src" href="#xd21e6300" name=
"xd21e6300src">76</a></p>
<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century, the M&#257;ppillas
massacred the chief of Anjengo, and all the English gentlemen belonging
to the settlement, when on a public visit to the Queen of
Altinga.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6307src" href="#xd21e6307" name=
"xd21e6307src">77</a> In 1841, seven or eight M&#257;ppillas killed two
Hindus, and took post in a mosque, setting the police at defiance.
They, and some of their co-religionists who had joined them, were shot
down by a party of sepoys. In the same month, some two thousand
M&#257;ppillas set at defiance a police guard posted over the spot
where the above criminals had been buried, and forcibly carried off
their bodies, to inter them with honours in a mosque.</p>

<p>An outbreak, which occurred in 1843, was celebrated in a stirring
ballad.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6318src" href="#xd21e6318" name=
"xd21e6318src">78</a> A series of M&#257;ppilla war-songs have been
published by Mr. Fawcett.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6321src" href=
"#xd21e6321" name="xd21e6321src">79</a> In October, 1843, a peon
(orderly) was found with his head and hand all but cut off, and the
perpetrators were supposed to have been M&#257;ppilla fanatics of the
sect known as H&#257;l Ilakkam (frenzy raising), concerning which the
following account was given in an official report, 1843. &ldquo;In the
month of M&#275;tam last year, one Alathamkuliyil Moid&#299;n went out
into the fields before daybreak to water the crops, and there he saw a
certain person, who advised him to give up all his work, and devote his
time to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb473" href="#pb473" name=
"pb473">473</a>]</span>prayer at the mosque. Moid&#299;n objected to
this, urging that he would have nothing to live upon. Whereupon, the
above-mentioned person told him that a palm tree, which grew in his
(Moid&#299;n&rsquo;s) compound, would yield sufficient toddy, which he
could convert into jaggery (crude sugar), and thus maintain himself.
After saying this, the person disappeared. Moid&#299;n thought that the
person he saw was God himself, and felt frantic (h&#257;l). He then
went to Taramal Tangal, and performed dikkar and nisk&#257;ram (cries
and prayers). After two or three days, he complained to the Tangal that
K&#257;firs (a term applied by Muhammadans to people of other
religions) were making fun of him. The Tangal told him that the course
adopted by him was the right one, and, saying &lsquo;Let it be as I
have said,&rsquo; gave him a spear to be borne as an emblem, and
assured him that nobody would mock him in future. Subsequently several
M&#257;ppillas, affecting h&#257;l ilakkam, played all sorts of pranks,
and wandered about with canes in their hands, without going to their
homes or attending to their work. After several days, some of them, who
had no means of maintaining themselves unless they attended to their
work, returned to their former course of life, while others, with canes
and Ern&#257;d knives (war knives) in their hands, wandered about in
companies of five, six, eight, or ten men, and, congregating in places
not much frequented by Hindus, carried on their dikkar and
nisk&#257;ram. The M&#257;ppillas in general look upon this as a
religious vow, and provide these people with food. I hear of the
M&#257;ppillas talking among themselves that one or two of the
ancestors of Taramal Tangal died fighting, that, the present man being
advanced in age, it is time for him to follow the same course, and that
the above-mentioned men affected with h&#257;l ilakkam, when their
number swells to four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href=
"#pb474" name="pb474">474</a>]</span>hundred, will engage in a fight
with K&#257;firs, and die in company with the Tangal. One of these men
(who are known as H&#257;lar), by name Avarum&#257;yan, two months ago
collected a number of his countrymen, and sacrificed a bull, and, for
preparing meals for these men, placed a copper vessel with water on the
hearth, and said that rice would appear of itself in the vessel. He
waited for some time. There was no rice to be seen. Those who had
assembled there <span class="corr" id="xd21e6328" title=
"Source: eat">ate</span> beef alone, and dispersed. Some people made
fun of Avarum&#257;yan for this. He felt ashamed, and went to Taramal
Tangal, with whom he stayed two or three days. He then went to the
mosque at Mambram, and, on attempting to fly through the air into the
mosque on the southern side of the river at Tirurang&#257;di, fell down
through the opening of the door, and became lame of one leg, in which
state he is reported to be still lying. While the H&#257;lar of
Munniy&#363;r d&#275;sam were performing nisk&#257;ram one day at the
tomb of Chemban Pokar M&#363;ppan, a rebel, they declared that in the
course of a week a mosque would spring up at night, and that there
would be complete darkness for two full days. M&#257;ppillas waited in
anxious expectation of the phenomenon for seven or eight days and
nights. There was, however, neither darkness nor mosque to be seen.
Again, in the month of Karkigadam last, some of the influential
M&#257;ppillas led their ignorant Hindu neighbours to believe that a
ship would arrive with the necessary arms, provisions, and money for
forty thousand men; and that, if that number could be secured
meanwhile, they could conquer the country, and that the Hindus would
then totally vanish. It appears that it was about this time that some
Tiyyar (toddy-drawers) and others became converts. None of the
predictions having been realised, M&#257;ppillas, as well as others,
have begun to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475</a>]</span>make fun of the H&#257;lar, who, having taken
offence at this, are bent upon putting an end to themselves by engaging
in a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the outbreak near Manjeri in 1849, when two companies of
sepoys were routed after firing a few shots, European troops have
always been engaged against the M&#257;ppillas. On the occasion of that
outbreak, one of the M&#257;ppillas had his thigh broken in the
engagement. He remained in all the agony of a wound unattended to for
seven days, and was further tortured by being carried in a rough litter
from the Manjeri to the Ang&#257;dipuram temple. Yet, at the time of a
further fight, he was hopping to the encounter on his sound leg, and
only anxious to get a fair blow at the infidels before he died. It is
recorded that, on one occasion, when a detachment of sepoys was thrown
into disorder by a fierce rush of death-devoted M&#257;ppillas, the
drummer of the company distinguished himself by bonneting an assailant
with his drum, thereby putting the M&#257;ppilla&rsquo;s head into a
kind of straight jacket, and saving his own life.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6336src" href="#xd21e6336" name="xd21e6336src">80</a> In 1852 Mr.
Strange was appointed Special Commissioner to enquire into the causes
of, and suggest remedies for, the M&#257;ppilla disturbances. In his
report he stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;a feature that has
been manifestly common to the whole of these affairs is that they have
been, one and all, marked by the most decided fanaticism, and this,
there can be no doubt, has furnished the true incentive to them. The
M&#257;ppillas of the interior were always lawless, even in the time of
Tippu, were steeped in ignorance, and were, on these accounts, more
than ordinarily susceptible to the teaching of ambitious and fanatical
priests using the recognised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href=
"#pb476" name="pb476">476</a>]</span>precepts of the Kor&#257;n as
handles for the sanction to rise and slay Kafirs, who opposed the
faithful, chiefly in the pursuit of agriculture. The Hindus, in the
parts where outbreaks have been most frequent, stand in such fear of
the M&#257;ppillas as mostly not to dare to press for their rights
against them, and there is many a M&#257;ppilla tenant who does not pay
his rent, and cannot, so imminent are the risks, be evicted.&rdquo; Mr.
Strange stated further that &ldquo;the most perverted ideas on the
doctrine of martyrdom, according to the Kor&#257;n, universally
prevail, and are fostered among the lower classes of the
M&#257;ppillas. The late enquiries have shown that there is a notion
prevalent among the lower orders that, according to the Mussalman
religion, the fact of a janmi or landlord having in due course of law
ejected from his lands a mortgagee or other substantial tenant, is a
sufficient pretext to murder him, become sahid (saint), and so ensure
the pleasures of the Muhammadan paradise. It is well known that the
favourite text of the banished Arab priest or Tangal, in his Friday
orations at the mosque in Tirurang&#257;di, was &lsquo;It is no sin,
but a merit, to kill a janmi who evicts.&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Strange
proposed the organisation of a special police force exclusively
composed of Hindus, and that restrictions should be put on the erection
of mosques. Neither of these proposals was approved by Government. But
a policy of repression set in with the passing of Acts XXII and XXIV of
1854. The former authorised the local authorities to escheat the
property of those guilty of fanatical rising, to fine the locality
where outrages had occurred, and to deport suspicious persons out of
the country. The latter rendered illegal the possession of the
M&#257;ppilla war-knife. Mr. Conolly, the District Magistrate,
proceeded, in December, 1854, on a tour, to collect the war-knives
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name=
"pb477">477</a>]</span>through the heart of the M&#257;ppilla country.
In the following year, when he was sitting in his verandah, a body of
fanatics, who had recently escaped from the Calicut jail, rushed in,
and hacked him to pieces in his wife&rsquo;s presence. He had quite
recently received a letter from Lord Dalhousie, congratulating him on
his appointment as a member of the Governor&rsquo;s Council at Madras.
His widow was granted the net proceeds of the M&#257;ppilla fines,
amounting to more than thirty thousand rupees.</p>
<p>In an account of an outbreak in 1851, it is noted that one of the
fanatics was a mere child. And it was noticed, in connection with a
more recent outbreak, that there were &ldquo;several boys who were
barely fourteen years old. One was twelve; some were seventeen or
eighteen. Some observers have said that the reason why boys turn
fanatics is because they may thus avoid the discomfort, which the
Ramzan entails. A dispensation from fasting is claimable when on the
war-path. There are high hopes of feasts of cocoanuts and jaggery, beef
and boiled rice. At the end of it all there is Paradise with its
black-eyed girls.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6348src" href=
"#xd21e6348" name="xd21e6348src">81</a></p>
<p>In 1859, Act No. XX for the suppression of outrages in the district
of Malabar was passed.</p>
<p>In 1884, Government appointed Mr. Logan, the Head Magistrate of
Malabar, to enquire into the general question of the tenure of land and
tenant right, and the question of sites for mosques and burial-grounds
in the district. Mr. Logan expressed his opinion that the M&#257;ppilla
outrages were designed &ldquo;to counteract the overwhelming influence,
when backed by the British courts, of the janmis in the exercise of the
novel powers of ouster, and of rent-raising conferred upon them. A
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478</a>]</span>janmi who, through the courts, evicted, whether
fraudulently or otherwise, a substantial tenant, was deemed to have
merited death, and it was considered a religious virtue, not a fault,
to have killed such a man, and to have afterwards died in arms,
fighting against an infidel Government.&rdquo; Mr. MacGregor, formerly
Collector of Malabar, had, some years before, expressed himself as
&ldquo;perfectly satisfied that the M&#257;ppilla outrages are
agrarian. Fanaticism is merely the instrument, through which the
terrorism of the landed classes is aimed at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1884 an outbreak occurred near Malappuram, and it was decided by
Government to disarm the t&#257;luks of Ern&#257;d, Calicut, and
Walluvan&#257;d. Notwithstanding the excited state of the
M&#257;ppillas at the time, the delicate operation was successfully
carried out by the district officers, and 17,295 arms, including 7,503
fire-arms of various kinds, were collected. In the following year, the
disarming of the Ponn&#257;ni t&#257;luk was accomplished. Of these
confiscated arms, the Madras Museum possesses a small collection,
selected from a mass of them which were hoarded in the
Collector&rsquo;s office, and were about to be buried in the deep
sea.</p>
<p>In 1896 a serious outbreak occurred at Manjeri, and two or three
notoriously objectionable landlords were done away with. The fanatics
then took up a position, and awaited the arrival of the British troops.
They took no cover, and, when advancing to attack, were mostly shot
down at a distance of 700 to 800 yards, every man wounded having his
throat cut by his nearest friend. In the outbreak of 1894, a
M&#257;ppilla youth was wounded, but not killed. The tidings was
conveyed to his mother, who merely said, with the stern majesty of the
Spartan matron of old, &lsquo;If I were a man, I would not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href="#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>come
back wounded.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6363src" href=
"#xd21e6363" name="xd21e6363src">82</a> &ldquo;Those who die fighting
for the faith are reverenced as martyrs and saints, who can work
miracles from the Paradise to which they have attained. A M&#257;ppilla
woman was once benighted in a strange place. An infidel passed by, and,
noticing her sorry plight, tried to take advantage of it to destroy her
virtue. She immediately invoked the aid of one of the martyrs of
Malappuram. A deadly serpent rushed out of a neighbouring thicket, and
flew at the villain, who had dared to sully the chastity of a chosen
daughter. Once, during a rising, a M&#257;ppilla, who preferred to
remain on the side of order and Government, stood afar off, and watched
with sorrow the dreadful sight of his co-religionists being cut down by
the European soldiery. Suddenly his emotions underwent a
transformation, for there, through his blinding tears and the dust and
smoke of the battle, he saw a wondrous vision. Lovely houris bent
tenderly over fallen martyrs, bathed their wounds, and gave them to
drink delicious sherbet and milk, and, with smiles that outshone the
brightness of the sun, bore away the fallen bodies of the brave men to
the realms beyond. The watcher dashed through the crowd, and cast in
his lot with the happy men who were fighting such a noble fight. And,
after he was slain, these things were revealed to his wife in a vision,
and she was proud thereat. These, and similar stories, are believed as
implicitly as the Kor&#257;n is believed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6366src" href="#xd21e6366" name="xd21e6366src">83</a></p>
<p>It is noted by Mr. Logan<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6372src" href=
"#xd21e6372" name="xd21e6372src">84</a> that the custom of the
N&#257;yars, in accordance with which they sacrificed their lives for
the honour of the king, &ldquo;was readily adopted by the
M&#257;ppillas, who also at times&mdash;as at the great Mah&#257;makham
twelfth year feast at Tirun&#257;v&#257;yi&mdash;devoted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480</a>]</span>themselves to death in the company of
N&#257;yars for the honour of the Valluvan&#257;d R&#257;ja. And
probably the frantic fanatical rush of the M&#257;ppillas on British
bayonets is the latest development of this ancient custom of the
N&#257;yars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fanatical outbreaks of recent times have been exclusively
limited to the Ern&#257;d and Walluvan&#257;d t&#257;luks. There are
quartered at the present time at Malappuram in the Ern&#257;d
t&#257;luk a special Assistant Collector, a company of British troops,
and a special native police force. In 1905, Government threw open 220
scholarships, on the results of the second and third standard
examinations, to M&#257;ppilla pupils of promise in the two t&#257;luks
mentioned above, to enable them to prosecute their studies for the next
higher standard in a recognised school connected with the Madras
Educational Department. Twenty scholarships were further offered to
M&#257;ppillas in the special class attached to the Government School
of Commerce, Calicut, where instruction in commercial arithmetic,
book-keeping, commercial practice, etc., is imparted in the
Malay&#257;lam language. In 1904, a M&#257;ppilla Sanskrit school was
founded at Putt&#363;r, some of the pupils at which belong to the
families of hereditary physicians, who were formerly good Sanskrit
scholars.</p>
<p>At a Loyalty meeting of M&#257;ppillas held at Ponn&#257;ni in 1908
under the auspices of the Mannath-ul-Islam Sabha, the President spoke
as follows. &ldquo;When the Moplahs are ranged on the side of order,
the peace of the country is assured. But the Moplah is viewed with
suspicion by the Government. He has got a bad name as a disturber of
the peace. He is liable to fits, and no one knows when he may run
amock. From this public platform I can assure the Government as well as
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=
"pb481">481</a>]</span>public that the proper remedy has at last been
applied, and the Moplah fits have ceased, never to return. What the
remedy was, and who discovered it, must be briefly explained. Every
Moplah outbreak was connected with the relapse of a convert. In the
heat of a family quarrel, in a moment of despair, a Hindu thought to
revenge himself upon his family by becoming a convert to Islam. In a
few days, repentance followed, and he went back to his relatives. An
ignorant Mullah made this a text for a sermon. A still more ignorant
villager found in it an opportunity to obtain admission into the
highest Paradise. An outbreak results. The apostate&rsquo;s throat is
cut. The Moplah is shot. Deportation and Punitive Police follow. The
only rational way to put a final stop to this chronic malady was
discovered by a Hindu gentleman. The hasty conversions must be stopped.
Those who seek conversion must be given plenty of time to consider the
irrevocable nature of the step they were going to take. The Mullahs
must be properly instructed. Their interpretation of the Koran was
wrong. There is absolutely nothing in our scriptures to justify murders
of this kind, or opposition to the ruling power. The ignorant people
had to be taught. There was no place in Paradise for murderers and
cut-throats. Their place was lower down. Three things had to be done.
Conversion had to be regulated; the Mullahs had to be instructed; the
ignorance of the people had to be removed. Ponani is the religious
head-quarters of the Moplahs of the West Coast, including Malabar,
South Canara, and the Native States of Cochin and Travancore. The
Jarathingal Thangal at Ponani is the High Priest of all the Moplahs;
the Mahadoom Thangal of Ponani is the highest authority in all
religious matters. It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href=
"#pb482" name="pb482">482</a>]</span>he that sanctifies the Musaliars.
The Mannath-ul-Islam Sabha at Ponani was started under the auspices of
the Jarathingal Thangal and the Mahadoom Thangal. Two schools were
opened for the education of new converts, one for boys and the other
for girls. Strict enquiries were made as to the state of mind and
antecedents of all who seek conversion. They are kept under observation
long enough, and are admitted only on the distinct understanding that
it is a deliberate voluntary act, and they have to make up their minds
to remain. Some six thousand converts have passed through our schools
since the Sabha was started. The Musaliars are never sanctified until
they are thoroughly grounded in the correct principles of our religion,
and an assurance is obtained from them that they will never preach
rebellion. No Musaliar will break a promise given to the Thangal. The
loyalty of the Musaliars and Mullahs is thus assured. Where there is no
Musaliar to bless them, there is no Moplah to die as a martyr. The
Mullahs are also taught to explain to all villagers that our scriptures
condemn opposition to the ruling power, and that loyalty to the
Sovereign is a religious duty. We are also trying to spread education
among the ignorant villagers. In order further to enlist the sympathies
of the people, extensive charities have been organised. Sixteen
branches of the Sabha have been opened all over South Malabar and the
States of Travancore and Cochin. A very large number of domestic
quarrels&mdash;divorce cases, partition cases, etc.&mdash;have been
settled by arbitration through these branch associations. It is an
immense power for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The M&#257;ppillas have been summed up, as regards their
occupations, as being traders on the coast, and cultivators in the
interior, in both of which callings they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb483" href="#pb483" name="pb483">483</a>]</span>are very successful
and prosperous. &ldquo;In the realm of industry,&rdquo; it has been
said, &ldquo;the Moplah occupies a position, which undoubtedly does him
credit. Poverty is confined almost exclusively to certain wild, yet
picturesque tracts in the east of Malabar, where the race constitutes
the preponderating element of the population, and the field and farm
furnish the only means of support to the people. And it is just in
those areas that one may see at their best the grit, laboriousness, and
enterprise of the Moplah. He reclaims dense forest patches, and turns
them into cultivated plots under the most unfavourable conditions, and,
in the course of a few years, by hard toil and perseverance, he
transforms into profitable homesteads regions that were erstwhile
virgin forest or scrubby jungle. Or he lays himself out to reclaim and
plant up marshy lands lying alongside rivers and lagoons, and insures
them from destruction by throwing up rough but serviceable dykes and
dams. In these tracts he is also sometimes a timber merchant, and gets
on famously by taking out permits to fell large trees, which he rafts
down the rivers to the coast. The great bulk of the Moplahs in these
wild regions belong purely to the labouring classes, and it is among
these classes that the pinch of poverty is most keenly felt,
particularly in the dull monsoon days, when all industry has to be
suspended. In the towns and coast ports, the Moplahs are largely
represented in most branches of industry and toil. A good many of them
are merchants, and get on exceedingly well, being bolder and more
speculative than the Hindus of the district. The bulk of petty traders
and shop-keepers in Malabar are also Moplahs, and, in these callings,
they may be found at great distances from home, in Rangoon, Ceylon, the
Straits and elsewhere, and generally prospering. Almost <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name=
"pb484">484</a>]</span>everywhere in their own district they go near
monopolising the grocery, hardware, haberdashery, and such other
trades; and as petty bazar men they drive a profitable business on the
good old principle of small profits and quick returns. No native hawker
caters more readily to Mr. Thomas Atkins (the British soldier) than the
Moplah, and, in the military stations in Malabar, &lsquo;Poker&rsquo;
(a Moplah name) waxes fat and grows rich by undertaking to supply Tommy
with tea, coffee, lemonade, tobacco, oilman stores, and other little
luxuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some M&#257;ppillas,&rdquo; Mr. A. Chatterton
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6394src" href="#xd21e6394" name=
"xd21e6394src">85</a> &ldquo;have taken to leather-working, and they
are considered to be specialists in the making of ceruppus or leather
shoes. In Malabar the trade in raw hides and skins is chiefly in the
hands of M&#257;ppillas. Weekly fairs are held at several places, and
all the available hides and skins are put up for sale, and are
purchased by Muhammadans.&rdquo; Some M&#257;ppillas bind books, and
others are good smiths. &ldquo;The small skull caps, which are the
universal head-gear of M&#257;ppilla men and boys, are made in
different parts of Malabar, but the best are the work of M&#257;ppilla
women at Cannanore. They are made of fine canvas beautifully
embroidered by hand, and fetch in the market between Rs. 2 and Rs.
3.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6397src" href="#xd21e6397" name=
"xd21e6397src">86</a></p>
<p>The M&#257;ppillas take an active share in the fish-curing
operations along the west coast, and the Mukkuvans, who are the
hereditary fishermen of Malabar, are inclined to be jealous of them. A
veteran Mukkuvan, at the time of my inspection of the Badagara
fish-curing yard in 1900, put the real grievance of his brethren in a
nutshell. In old days, he stated, they used salt-earth for curing
fishes. When the fish-curing yards were started, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485" name="pb485">485</a>]</span>and
Government salt was issued, the Mukkuvans thought that they were going
to be heavily taxed. They did not understand exactly what was going to
happen, and were suspicious. The result was that they would have
nothing to do with the curing-yards. The use of salt-earth was stopped
on the establishment of Government salt, and some of the fishermen were
convicted for illegal use thereof. They thought that, if they held out,
they would be allowed to use salt-earth as formerly. Meanwhile, the
M&#257;ppillas, being more wide-awake than the Mukkuvans, took
advantage of the opportunity (in 1884), and erected yards, whereof they
are still in possession. A deputation of Mukkuvans waited on me. Their
main grievance was that they are hereditary fishermen, and formerly the
M&#257;ppillas were only the purchasers of fish. A few years ago, the
M&#257;ppillas started as fishermen on their own account, with small
boats and thattuvala (tapping nets), in using which the nets, with
strips of cocoanut leaves tied on to the ropes, are spread, and the
sides of the boats beaten with sticks and staves, to drive the fish
into the net. The noise made extends to a great distance, and
consequently the shoals go out to sea, too far for the fishermen to
follow in pursuit. In a petition, which was submitted to me by the
Mukkuvan fish-curers at Badagara, they asked to have the site of the
yard changed, as they feared that their women would be
&lsquo;unchastised&rsquo; at the hands of the M&#257;ppillas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small isolated attempts,&rdquo; Major Holland-Pryor writes,
&ldquo;to recruit M&#257;ppillas were made by various regiments
quartered in Malabar some years ago, but without success. This was
probably owing to the fact that the trial was made on too small a
scale, and that the system of mixed companies interfered with their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=
"pb486">486</a>]</span>clannish propensities. The district officers
also predicted certain failure, on the ground that M&#257;ppillas would
not serve away from their own country. Their predictions, however, have
proved to be false, and men now come forward in fair numbers for
enlistment.&rdquo; In 1896, the experiment of recruiting M&#257;ppillas
for the 25th Madras Infantry was started, and the responsible task of
working up the raw material was entrusted to Colonel Burton, with whose
permission I took measurements of his youthful warriors. As was
inevitable in a community recruited by converts from various classes,
the sepoys afforded an interesting study in varied colouration, stature
and nasal configuration. One very dark-skinned and platyrhine
individual, indeed, had a nasal index of 92. Later on, the sanction of
the Secretary of State was obtained for the adoption of a scheme for
converting the 17th and 25th regiments of the Madras Infantry into
M&#257;ppilla corps, which were subsequently named the 77th and 78th
Moplah Rifles. &ldquo;These regiments,&rdquo; Major Holland-Pryor
continues, &ldquo;at present draw their men principally from Ern&#257;d
and Valuvan&#257;d. Labourers from these parts are much sought after by
planters and agents from the Kolar gold-fields, on account of their
hardiness and fine physique. Some, however, prefer to enlist. The men
are generally smaller than the Coast M&#257;ppillas, and do not show
much trace of Arab blood, but they are hardy and courageous, and, with
their superior stamina, make excellent fighting material.&rdquo; In
1905 the 78th Moplah Rifles were transferred to D&#275;ra Ismail
Kh&#257;n in the Punj&#257;b, and took part in the military
man&oelig;uvres before H.R.H. the Prince of Wales at Rawalpindi. It has
been observed that &ldquo;the Moplahs, in dark green and scarlet, the
only regiment in India which wears the tarbush, are notable examples
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>of the policy of taming the pugnacious races by
making soldiers of them, which began with the enlistment of the
Highlanders in the Black Watch, and continued to the disciplining of
the Kachins in Burma. In the general overhauling of the Indian Army,
the fighting value of the Moplahs has come into question, and the 78th
Regiment is now at D&#275;ra Ismail Kh&#257;n being measured against
the crack regiments of the north.&rdquo; In 1907, the colours of the
17th Madras Infantry, which was formed at Fort St. George in 1777, and
had had its name changed to 77th Moplah Rifles, were, on the regiment
being mustered out, deposited in St. Mark&rsquo;s Church,
Bangalore.</p>
<p>It has been said of the M&#257;ppillas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6412src" href="#xd21e6412" name="xd21e6412src">87</a> that
&ldquo;their heads are true cocoanuts; their high foreheads and pointed
crowns are specially noticeable for being kept shaven, and, when
covered, provided with only a small gaily embroidered
skull-cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dress of the M&#257;ppillas is thus described in the Gazetteer
of Malabar. &ldquo;The ordinary dress of the men is a mundu or cloth,
generally white with a purple border, but sometimes orange or green, or
plain white. It is tied on the left (Hindus tie it on the right), and
kept in position by a n&#363;l or waist string, to which are attached
one or more elassus (small cylinders) of gold, silver, or baser metal,
containing texts from the Kor&#257;n or magic yantrams. A small knife
is usually worn at the waist. Persons of importance wear in addition a
long flowing garment of fine cotton (a kind of burnoos), and over this
again may be worn a short waistcoat like jacket, though this is
uncommon in South Malabar, and (in the case of Tangals, etc.) a cloak
of some rich <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name=
"pb488">488</a>]</span>coloured silk. The European shirt and short coat
are also coming into fashion in the towns. A small cap of white or
white and black is very commonly worn, and round this an ordinary
turban, or some bright coloured scarf may be tied. M&#257;ppillas shave
their heads clean. Beards are frequently worn, especially by old people
and Tangals. Hajis, or men who have made their pilgrimage to Mecca, and
other holy men, often dye the beard red. Women wear a mundu of some
coloured cloth (dark blue is most usual), and a white loose bodice more
or less embroidered, and a veil or scarf on the head. In the case of
the wealthy, the mundu may be of silk of some light colour. Women of
the higher classes are kept secluded, and hide their faces when they go
abroad. The lower classes are not particular in this respect. Men wear
no jewellery, except the elassus already mentioned, and in some cases
rings on the fingers, but these should not be of pure gold.
Women&rsquo;s jewellery is of considerable variety, and is sometimes
very costly. It takes the form of necklaces, ear-rings, zones,
bracelets, and anklets. As among Tiyans and Mukkuvans, a great number
of ear-rings are worn. The rim of the ear is bored into as many as ten
or a dozen holes, in addition to the one in the lobe. Nose-rings are
not worn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incredibly large sums of money,&rdquo; Mr. P. Kunjain
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6423src" href="#xd21e6423" name=
"xd21e6423src">88</a> &ldquo;are spent on female ornaments. For the
neck there are five or six sorts, for the waist five or six sorts, and
there are besides long rows of armlets, bracelets, and bangles, and
anklets and ear ornaments, all made of gold. As many as ten or fourteen
holes are bored in each ear, one being in the labia (lobe) and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name=
"pb489">489</a>]</span>remainder in the ala (helix). The former is
artificially widened, and a long string of ornaments of beautiful
manufacture suspended to it. As strict Sunnis of the Shafi school, the
boring of the nose is prohibited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have in my possession five charm cylinders, which were worn round
the waist by a notorious M&#257;ppilla dacoit, who was shot by the
police, and whom his co-religionists tried to turn into a saint. It is
noted, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that, though magic is condemned by
the Kor&#257;n, the M&#257;ppilla is very superstitious, and witchcraft
is not by any means unknown. Many Tangals pretend to cure diseases by
writing selections from the Kor&#257;n on a plate with ink or on a
coating of ashes, and then giving the ink or ashes mixed with water to
the patient to swallow. They also dispense scrolls for elassus, and
small flags inscribed with sacred verses, which are set up to avert
pestilence or misfortune. The M&#257;ppilla jins and shait&#257;ns
correspond to the Hindu demons, and are propitiated in much the same
way. One of their methods of witchcraft is to make a wooden figure to
represent the enemy, drive nails into all the vital parts, and throw it
into sea, after curses in due form. A belief in love philtres and
talismans is very common, and precautions against the evil eye are
universal.</p>
<p>In 1903, a life-size nude female human figure, with feet everted and
turned backwards, carved out of the wood of <i>Alstonia scholaris</i>,
was washed ashore at Calicut. Long nails had been driven in all over
the head, body and limbs, and a large square hole cut out above the
navel. Inscriptions in Arabic characters were scrawled over it. By a
coincidence, the corpse of a man was washed ashore close to the figure.
Quite recently, another interesting example of sympathetic magic, in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490" name=
"pb490">490</a>]</span>the shape of a wooden representation of a human
being, was washed ashore at Calicut. The figure is eleven inches in
height. The arms are bent on the chest, and the palms of the hands are
placed together as in the act of saluting. A square cavity, closed by a
wooden lid, has been cut out of the middle of the abdomen, and contains
apparently tobacco, ganja (Indian hemp), and hair. An iron bar has been
driven from the back of the head through the body, and terminates in
the abdominal cavity. A sharp cutting instrument has been driven into
the chest and back in twelve places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The M&#257;ppillas of North Malabar,&rdquo; Mr. Lewis Moore
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6445src" href="#xd21e6445" name=
"xd21e6445src">89</a> &ldquo;follow the marumakkath&#257;yam system of
inheritance, while the M&#257;ppillas of South Malabar, with some few
exceptions, follow the ordinary Muhammadan law. Among those who profess
to follow the marumakkath&#257;yam law, the practice frequently
prevails of treating the self-acquisitions of a man as descendible to
his wife and children under Muhammadan law. Among those who follow the
ordinary Muhammadan law, it is not unusual for a father and sons to
have community of property, and for the property to be managed by the
father, and, after his death, by the eldest son. Mr. Logan<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6449src" href="#xd21e6449" name=
"xd21e6449src">90</a> alludes to the adoption of the
marumakkath&#257;yam law of inheritance by the Namb&#363;dris of
Payyanur in North Malabar, and then writes &lsquo;And it is noteworthy
that the Muhammadans settled there (M&#257;ppillas) have done the same
thing.&rsquo; Mr. Logan here assumes that the M&#257;ppillas of North
Malabar were Muhammadans in religion before they adopted the
marumakkath&#257;yam law of inheritance. There can, however, be but
little doubt that a considerable portion, at all events, of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name=
"pb491">491</a>]</span>these so-called M&#257;ppillas were followers of
marumakkath&#257;yam rules and customs long before they embraced the
faith of Islam.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the case of the M&#257;ppillas,&rdquo;
Mr. Vaidyanatha writes, &ldquo;it is more than probable that there were
more numerous conversions from marumakkath&#257;yam families in the
north than in the south. The number of makkath&#257;yam adherents has
always been small in the north. According to marumakkath&#257;yam, the
wife is not a member of the husband&rsquo;s family, but usually resides
in her family house. The makkath&#257;yam M&#257;ppillas, curiously
enough, seldom take their wives home. In some parts, such as Calicut, a
husband is only a visitor for the night. The M&#257;ppillas, like the
N&#257;yars, call themselves by the names of their houses (or
parambas).&rdquo; It is noted by Mr. P. Kunjain<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6454src" href="#xd21e6454" name="xd21e6454src">91</a> that the
present generation of Moplahs following marumakkath&#257;yam is not
inclined to favour the perpetuation of this flagrant transgression of
the divine law, which enjoins makkath&#257;yam on true believers in
unequivocal terms. With the view of defeating the operation of the law,
the present generation settled their self-acquisition on their children
during their lifetime. A proposal to alter the law to accord with the
divine law will be hailed with supreme pleasure. This is the current of
public opinion among Moplahs.</p>
<p>It is recorded in the Gazetteer of Malabar that &ldquo;in North
Malabar, M&#257;ppillas as a rule follow the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6460" title=
"Source: marumakkat&#257;yam">marumakkath&#257;yam</span> system of
inheritance, though it is opposed to the precepts of the Kor&#257;n;
but a man&rsquo;s self-acquisitions usually descend to his wife and
family in accordance with the Muhammadan law of property. The
combination of the two systems of law often leads to great
complications. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name=
"pb492">492</a>]</span>In the south, the makkat&#257;yam system is
usually followed, but it is remarkable that succession to religious
st&#257;nams, such as that of the Valiya Tangal of Ponn&#257;ni,
usually goes according to the <span class="corr" id="xd21e6465" title=
"Source: marumakkat&#257;yam">marumakkath&#257;yam</span> system. There
seems to be a growing discontent with the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e6468" title=
"Source: marumakkat&#257;yam">marumakkath&#257;yam</span> system; but,
on the other hand, there is no doubt that the minute sub-division of
property between a man&rsquo;s heirs, which the Kor&#257;n prescribes,
tends to foster poverty, especially amongst petty cultivators, such as
those of Ern&#257;d and Walavan&#257;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to linger over the naming, tonsure, circumcision,
and ear-boring ceremonies, which the M&#257;ppilla infant has to go
through. But the marriage and death customs are worthy of some
notice.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6474src" href="#xd21e6474" name=
"xd21e6474src">92</a> &ldquo;Boys are married at the age of 18 or 20 as
a rule in North Malabar, and girls at 14 or 15. In South Malabar, early
marriages are more common, boys being married between 14 and 18, and
girls between 8 and 12. In exceptional cases, girls have been known to
be married at the age of 2&frac12;, but this only happens when the
girl&rsquo;s father is <i>in extremis</i>, since an orphan must remain
unmarried till puberty. The first thing is the betrothal or settlement
of the dowry, which is arranged by the parents, or in North Malabar by
the K&#257;rnavans. Large dowries are expected, especially in North
Malabar, where, in spite of polygamy, husbands are at a premium, and a
father with many daughters needs to be a rich man. The only religious
ceremony necessary is the nikka, which consists in the formal
conclusion of the contract before two witnesses and the K&#257;zi, who
then registers it. The nikka may be performed either on the day of the
nuptials or before it, sometimes months or years before. In the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name=
"pb493">493</a>]</span>latter case, the fathers of the bride and
bridegroom go to the bride&rsquo;s family mosque and repeat the
necessary formula, which consists in the recital of the Kalima, and a
formal acceptance of the conditions of the match, thrice repeated. In
the former case, the K&#257;zi, as a rule, comes to the bride&rsquo;s
house where the ceremony is performed, or else the parties go to the
K&#257;zi&rsquo;s house. In North Malabar, the former is the rule; but
in Calicut the K&#257;zi will only go to the houses of four specially
privileged families. After the performance of the nikka, there is a
feast in the bride&rsquo;s house. Then the bridegroom and his
attendants are shown to a room specially prepared, with a curtain over
the door. The bridegroom is left there alone, and the bride is
introduced into the room by her mother or sister. In North Malabar, she
brings her dowry with her, wrapped in a cloth. She is left with the
bridegroom for a few minutes, and then comes out, and the bridegroom
takes his departure. In some cases, the bride and bridegroom are
allowed to spend the whole night together. In some parts of South
Malabar, it is the bride who is first conducted to the nuptial chamber,
where she is made to lie down on a sofa, and the bridegroom is then
introduced, and left with her for a few minutes. In North Malabar and
Calicut, the bride lives in her own house with her mother and sisters,
unless her husband is rich enough to build her a house of her own. In
South Malabar, the wife is taken to the husband&rsquo;s house as soon
as she is old enough for cohabitation, and lives there. Polygamy is the
rule, and it is estimated that in South Malabar 80 per cent. of the
husbands have two wives or more, and 20 per cent. three or four. In
North Malabar, it is not usual for a man to have more than two wives.
The early age at which girls are married in South Malabar no doubt
encourages polygamy. It also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb494" href=
"#pb494" name="pb494">494</a>]</span>encourages divorce, which in South
Malabar is common, while in the north it is comparatively rare, and
looked upon with disfavour. All that is required is for the husband to
say, in the presence of the wife&rsquo;s relations, or before her
K&#257;zi, that he has &lsquo;untied the tie, and does not want the
wife any more,&rsquo; and to give back the stridhanam or dowry. Divorce
by the wife is rare, and can be had only for definite reasons, such as
that the husband is incapable of maintaining her, or is incurably
diseased or impotent. Widows may remarry without limit, but the dearth
of husbands makes it difficult for them to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man dies, his body is undressed, and arranged so that
the legs point to Mecca. The two big toes are tied together, and the
hands crossed on the chest, the right over the left; the arms are also
tied with a cloth. Mullas are called in to read the Kor&#257;n over the
corpse, and this has to be continued until it is removed to the
cemetery. When the relatives have arrived, the body is washed and laid
on the floor on mats, over which a cloth has been spread. Cotton wool
is placed in the ears, and between the lips, the fingers, and the toes,
and the body is shrouded in white cloths. It is then placed on a bier
which is brought from the mosque, and borne thither. At the mosque the
bier is placed near the western wall; the mourners arrange themselves
in lines, and offer prayers (nisk&#257;ram) standing. The bier is then
taken to the grave, which is dug north and south; the body is lowered,
the winding sheets loosened, and the body turned so as to lie on its
right side facing Mecca. A handful of earth is placed below the right
cheek. The grave is then covered with laterite stones, over which each
of the mourners throws a handful of earth, reciting the Kalima and
passages from the Kor&#257;n. Laterite stones are placed at the head
and foot of the grave, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href=
"#pb495" name="pb495">495</a>]</span>some mail&#257;nji (henna:
<i>Lawsonia alba</i>) is planted at the side. A Mulla then seats
himself at the head of the grave, and reads certain passages of the
Kor&#257;n, intended to instruct the dead man how to answer the
questions about his faith, which it is supposed that the angels are
then asking him. The funeral concludes with distribution of money and
rice to the poor. For three days, a week, or forty days, according to
the circumstances of the deceased, Mullas should read the Kor&#257;n
over the grave without ceasing day and night. The Kor&#257;n must also
be read at home for at least three days. On the third day, a visit is
made to the tomb, after which a maulad is performed, the Mullas are
paid, alms are distributed, and a feast is given to the relations,
including the deceased&rsquo;s relations by marriage, who should come
to his house that day. A similar ceremony is performed on the fortieth
day, which concludes the mourning; and by the rich on anniversaries.
Widows should keep secluded in their own houses for three months and
ten days, without seeing any of the male sex. After that period, they
are at liberty to remarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the M&#257;ppillas of the Laccadives, Mr. H. A. Stuart
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6493src" href=
"#xd21e6493" name="xd21e6493src">93</a> &ldquo;The customs of the
M&#257;ppillas of the Laccadive islands are peculiar. The people are
not called M&#257;ppilas, but (1) K&#333;ya, (2) M&#257;lumi, (3)
Urukk&#257;ran, (4) Takru, (5) Milikh&#257;n, and (6)
M&#275;l&#257;c&rsquo;ch&#275;ri. No. 1 is the land and boat owning
class, and is superior to the rest. Nos. 2 to 5 are pilots and sailors,
and, where they are cultivators, cultivate under No. 1. No. 6 were the
slaves of the first division; now they cultivate the K&#333;yas&rsquo;
lands, take the produce of those lands in boats to the mainland, and
pay 20 per <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496</a>]</span>cent. of the sale-proceeds to the K&#333;ya
owners. The islanders generally dress like ordinary M&#257;ppilas. The
M&#275;l&#257;c&rsquo;cheris, however, may use only a coarser kind of
cloth, and they are not allowed intermarriage with the other classes.
If any such marriage takes place, the offender is put out of caste, but
the marriage is deemed a valid one. The current tradition is that these
Laccadive M&#257;ppilas were originally the inhabitants of
Malabar&mdash;Namb&#363;diris, N&#257;yars, Tiyyas, etc.&mdash;who went
in search of Ch&#275;ram&#257;n Perum&#257;l when the latter left for
Mecca, and were wrecked on these islands. The story goes that these
remained Hindus for a long time, that Obeidulla, the disciple of Caliph
Abu Bakr, having received instructions from the prophet in a dream to
go and convert the unbelievers on these islands, left for the place and
landed on Am&#275;ni island, that he was ill-treated by the people, who
were all Br&#257;hmans, but that, having worked some miracles, he
converted them. He then visited the other islands, and all the
islanders embraced the Moslem faith. His remains are said to be
interred in the island of Androth. Among this section of the
M&#257;ppilas, succession is generally&mdash;in fact almost
entirely&mdash;in the female line. Girls are married when they are six
or seven years old. No dowry is given. They are educated equally with
the boys, and, on marriage, they are not taken away from school, but
continue there until they finish the course. In the island of Minicoy,
the largest of the islands, the women appear in public, and take part
in public affairs. The women generally are much more educated than the
ordinary M&#257;ppila males of the mainland. The K&#333;yas are said to
be descendants of Namb&#363;diris, M&#275;lach&rsquo;cheris of Tiyyans
and Mukkuvans, and the rest of N&#257;yars. Whatever the present
occupation of K&#333;yas on these islands, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb497" href="#pb497" name=
"pb497">497</a>]</span>tradition that K&#333;yas were originally
Br&#257;hmans also confirms the opinion that they belong to the
priestly class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a note on the Laccadives and Minicoy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6502src" href="#xd21e6502" name="xd21e6502src">94</a> Mr. C. W.
E. Cotton writes that &ldquo;while it would appear that the Maldives
and Minicoy were long ago peopled by the same wave of Aryan immigration
which overran Ceylon, tradition ascribes the first settlements in the
northern group to an expedition shipwrecked on one of the Atolls so
late as 825 A.D. This expedition is said to have set out from
<span class="corr" id="xd21e6505" title=
"Source: Kodungalur">Kodungall&#363;r</span> (Cranganore) in search of
the last of the Perumal Viceroys of Malabar, a convert either to
Buddhism or Islam, and included some Nambudris, commonly employed, as
Duarte Barbosa tells us, on account of their persons being considered
sacrosanct, as envoys and messengers in times of war, and perhaps also
for dangerous embassies across the seas. Some support may be found for
this tradition in the perpetuation of the name illam for some of the
principal houses in Kalpeni, and in the existence of strongly marked
caste divisions, especially remarkable among communities professing
Mahomedanism, corresponding to the aristocrats, the mariners, and the
dependants, of which such an expeditionary force would have been
composed. The Tarwad islands, Ameni, Kalpeni, Androth, and Kavarathi,
were probably peopled first, and their inhabitants can claim high-caste
Hindu ancestry. There has been no doubt everywhere considerable
voluntary immigration from the coast, and some infusion of pure Arab
blood; but the strain of Negro introduced into the Maldives by Zanzibar
slaves is nowhere traceable in Minicoy or the northern
Archipelago.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498"
name="pb498">498</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a further note, Mr. Cotton writes as follows.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6511src" href="#xd21e6511" name="xd21e6511src">95</a>
&ldquo;The inhabitants of Androth, Kalp&#275;ni, Kavaratti and Agatti,
are M&#257;ppillas, almost undistinguishable, except in the matter of
physical development, from those on the mainland. The admixture of Arab
blood seems to be confined to a few of the principal families in the
two &lsquo;tarwad&rsquo; islands, Kalp&#275;ni and Androth. The
islanders, though Muhammadans, perpetuate the old caste distinctions
which they observed before their conversion to Islam. The highest caste
is called Koya, in its origin merely a religious title. The Koyas
represent the aristocracy of the original colonists, and in them vests
the proprietorship of most of the cocoanut trees and the odams (ships),
which constitute the chief outward and visible signs of wealth on the
islands. They supply each Am&#299;n with a majority of his council of
hereditary elders (K&#257;ranavans). The lowest and largest class is
that of the Melacheris (lit. high climbers), also called Thand&#275;ls
in Kavaratti, the villeins in the quasi-feudal system of the islands,
who do the tree-tapping, cocoanut plucking, and menial labour. They
hold trees on kudiyan service, which involves the shipping of produce
on their overlord&rsquo;s boat or odam, the thatching of his house and
boat-shed, and an obligation to sail on the odam to the mainland
whenever called upon. Intermediately come the Malumis (pilots), also
called Urakars, who represent the skilled navigating class, to which
many of the Karnavans in Kavaratti belong. Intermarriage between them
and the less prosperous Koyis is now permitted. Monogamy is almost the
universal rule, but divorces can be so easily obtained that the
marriage tie can scarcely be regarded <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb499" href="#pb499" name="pb499">499</a>]</span>as more binding than
the sambandham among the Hindus on the coast. The women go about freely
with their heads uncovered. They continue to live after marriage in
their family or tarwad houses, where they are visited by their
husbands, and the system of inheritance in vogue is <span class="corr"
id="xd21e6516" title=
"Source: marumakkat&#257;yam">marumakkath&#257;yam</span> as regards
family property, and makkat&#257;yam as regards self-acquisitions.
These are distinguished on the islands under the terms
Velliy&#257;richa (Friday) and Tingal&#257;richa (Monday) property. The
family house is invariably called pura in contradistinction to
V&#299;du&mdash;the wife&rsquo;s house. Intermarriage between the
inhabitants of different islands is not uncommon. The islanders are
very superstitious, and believe in ghosts and hobgoblins, about the
visible manifestations of which many stories are current; and there is
an old m&#257;mul (established) rule on all the islands forbidding any
one to go out after nightfall. Phantom steamers and sailing ships are
sometimes seen in the lagoons or rowed out to on the open sea; and in
the prayers by the graves of his ancestors, which each sailor makes
before setting out on a voyage, we find something akin to the Roman
worship of the Manes. The Moid&#299;n mosque at Kalp&#275;ni, and the
big West Pand&#257;ram at Androth are believed to be haunted. There are
J&#257;rams (shrines) in Cheriyam and Cheriyakara, to which pilgrimages
are made and where vows are taken, and it is usual to chant the
fat&#275;ah<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6519src" href="#xd21e6519" name=
"xd21e6519src">96</a> on sighting the Jamath mosque in Androth, beneath
the shadow of which is the tomb of Mumba Mulyaka, the Arab apostle to
the Laccadives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his inspection report of the Laccadives, 1902, Mr. G. H. B.
Jackson notes that &ldquo;the caste barrier, on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb500" href="#pb500" name=
"pb500">500</a>]</span>island of Androth, between the Koya and the
Malumi class and the Melacheris is as rigid as ever. It divides capital
from labour, and has given the upper classes much of the appearance of
an effete aristocracy.&rdquo; In a more recent inspection report
(1905), Mr. C. W. E. Cotton writes as follows. &ldquo;Muhammadans,
owing to their inordinate love of dress, are apt to give an exaggerated
impression of wealth, but I should think that, despite the laziness of
all but the Melacheris, the majority of the inhabitants (of Androth)
are well-to-do, and, in this respect, compare very favourably with
those of the other islands. The Qazi and several other Karnavars, who
have a smattering of the Kor&#257;n, go to the mainland, and, in
centres of superstition, earn considerable sums by their profession of
extreme learning and piety. The long satin coats (a canary yellow is
the fashionable tint) procured in Bombay or Mangalore are evidence of
the financial success of their pilgrimages. It is perhaps fortunate
that the Koyas have discovered this additional source of income, for,
though they continue to own nearly all the cargo-carrying odams
(boats), their position as jenmis (landlords) has been seriously
jeopardised owing to the repudiation of their obligations as Kudians by
many of the enterprising Melacheri community. The Melacheris are now
alive to the fact that, as their tenure is not evidenced by documents
and rests upon oral assertions, they have a very reasonable chance of
freeing themselves of their overlords altogether. The Mukhyastars are
quite a representative lot. Sheikindevittil Muthu Koya is a fine
specimen of the sea-faring Moplah, and the Qazi, twenty-fourth in
descent from Mumby Moolyaka, the Arab who converted the islanders to
Islam, struck me as a man of very considerable attainments. In his
report on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href="#pb501" name=
"pb501">501</a>]</span>dispensary at Androth (1905), Mr. K. Ibrahim
Kh&#257;n, hospital assistant, states that &ldquo;the quacks are said
to be clever enough to treat cases both by their drugs and by their
charms. They actually prevent other poor classes seeking medical and
surgical treatment in the dispensary, and mislead them by their cunning
words. Most of the quacks come to the dispensary, and take medicines
such as santonine powders, quinine pills, purgatives, etc. They make
use of these for their own cases, and thus earn their livelihood. The
quacks are among the Koya class. The Koyas are jenmis, and the Malims
and Melacheris are their tenants. The latter, being low classes, always
believe them, and depend upon their landlords, who are also their
physicians, to treat them when they fall sick. The islanders, as a
rule, have no faith in English medical treatment. The rich folks who
can afford it go to Malabar for native treatment; only the poorer
classes, who have neither means to pay the quacks here nor to go to
Malabar, attend the dispensary with half inclination.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Marak&#257;llu.</b>&mdash;Marak&#257;llu or Marak&#257;du,
meaning fishermen, has been recorded as a sub-division of Pallis
engaged as fishermen in the Telugu country. The equivalent of Mukku
Marakk&#257;l&#275;ru is a title or synonym of M&#333;ger and
Marakk&#257;n of Mukkuvan. Marakk&#257;yar is a title of Labbai
boatmen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name=
